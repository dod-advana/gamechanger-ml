Testing Policy. 1 Enlistment qualification tests will not be administered to applicants who are otherwise ineligible for enlistment. 2 The recruiting Service is responsible for ensuring that the applicant meets basic eligibility requirements to enlist before sponsoring an individual for MEPS or MET site ASVAB testing. 3 The USMEPCOM Form 6803AE Request for Examination available on the USMEPCOM website is required to authorize the applicant\u2019s enlistment qualification testing or retesting. Accuracy of the data elements on the form is the responsibility of the applicant and the recruiter. The ASVAB will not be administered to any applicant unless a fully completed and certified USMEPCOM Form 6803AE is presented before testing. 4 The enlistment ASVAB is solely for the testing of individuals specifically applying for enlistment. The enlistment ASVAB is not to test students in educational institutions. 5 Testing applicants for enlistment with the ASVAB by other than MEPSdesignated personnel is not authorized except utilizing the online unproctored ASVAB or in overseas areas. 6 The ASVAB scores are valid for enlistment purposes including the DEP for 2 years from the date of test administration. In all cases the most recent valid ASVAB score is the score of record and is the only score that can be used for enlistment processing purposes. 7 To take the enlistment ASVAB applicants must provide photographic identification e.g. driver\u2019s license student identification card military dependent identification card or passport to the test administrator TA. Applicants without photographic identification will be required to have their right thumbprint imprinted on the USMEPCOM Form 6803AE. Applicants without photographic identification and who refuse to render a thumbprint will be denied the opportunity to test. 8 During processing applicant signatures will be compared to ensure proper applicant identification. Locations operating with USMEPCOM identity management software do not require the applicant to present photographic identification or manually thumbprint an applicant on USMEPCOM Form 6803AE before testing. DoDM 1145.02 July 23 2018 SECTION 4 APTITUDE STANDARDS 19 9 Personnel in the DEP will not retest with the enlistment or student ASVAB. 10 The first ASVAB administered whether in the enlistment or student program is the initial test of an applicant. An exception is a test administered in the school testing program to a student in the 10th grade this test cannot be used for enlistment purposes and therefore it does not count as a first test. Any subsequent testing with the ASVAB enlistment or student within 2 years of any previous test is considered a retest retest policy is addressed in Paragraph 4.7 of this issuance. 11 An applicant who has answered at least one question on the ASVAB is considered to have tested. 12 A TA is not authorized to test an individual who in their judgment appears to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs. 13 Under normal circumstances the applicant\u2019s test results will only be provided to the sponsoring recruiting Service. Test results will not be given directly to the applicant after testing. 14 Cameras cellular telephones or any other personal electronic devices are prohibited within any testing area. 15 Applicants detected receiving or using unauthorized assistance e.g. unauthorized notes or study questions talking during the test or gazing onto a neighbor\u2019s test or committing other inappropriate conduct e.g. working on a portion of the test other than the one being administered or using a calculator slide rule cellular telephone electronic translator or other mechanical device will not be allowed to continue to test. If testing is complete their test results will be invalidated. 16 Applicants leaving the test room without authorization will have their test results invalidated. 17 In all cases where a test is invalidated the individual will be prohibited from further testing for 6 calendar months. Additionally results of an invalidated test cannot be used for enlistment purposes. 18 In addition to administering the ASVAB MEPS personnel are authorized to administer approved special purpose tests. Special purpose testing will not be scheduled or conducted in a manner that impairs the ability of the MEPS concerned to complete enlistment or student testing missions. Special Purpose Testing is explained in Paragraph 4.4 of this issuance. 19 The MEPS TA will not administer the ASVAB to other personnel military or civilian assigned to the same MEPS. 20 At paperandpencil MET sites only the unverified Armed Forces Qualification Test AFQT score may be released to the sponsoring recruiting Service. At CATASVAB MET DoDM 1145.02 July 23 2018 SECTION 4 APTITUDE STANDARDS 20 sites all scores on the CATASVAB unverified score report may be released to the sponsoring recruiting Service. 21 MEPS and recruiting personnel may not use ASVAB tests locally developed test questions test aids or commercial study guides to familiarize applicants or potential applicant with the ASVAB. Applicants may be advised that commercial study guides are available however commercial study guides will not be maintained in any MEPS or MET site facility or in the possession of MEPS and recruiting personnel for use by applicants. The MEPS and recruiting personnel will not participate in applicant study preparation nor provide or recommend actions that would afford an applicant with an unfair advantage towards improving ASVAB scores. The TAs will report anyone seeking inappropriate testing assistance to the MEPS commander. c. MET Site 1 Management. HQ USMEPCOM and local MEPS policies and procedures in conjunction with the IRC outline the management of USMEPCOM processing location MET sites. USMEPCOM will manage the proctor ratio to ensure approved testing can be completed. 2 MET Site Facilities. a MET site facilities located outside of the MEPS intended to be used for the aptitude testing of applicants will be designated by the MEPS commander after coordination with voting and nonvoting members of the IRC in accordance with policies and procedures prescribed by HQ USMEPCOM. The function for locating identifying and coordinating the use of facilities outside the MEPS will be shared by all members of the IRC. b Procedures for the administration and protection of enlistment aptitude tests and computer equipment are prescribed in USMEPCOM policies and procedures which are applicable to all military recruiting Services MEPS and users of MEPS facilities including MET sites. c Provisions of travel for applicants to and from USMEPCOM processing location test sites is the responsibility of the recruiting Services. This includes providing meals. d In accordance with USMEPCOM policies and procedures the following facility requirements will be met when administering an aptitude test. 1. Desks or tables with writing surfaces that are flat and smooth and wide enough to accommodate the test and answer sheets 2. Chairs will not have writing arms 3. Test rooms will have proper illumination ventilation and be temperature controlled. They will also be free from noise and visual distractions and 4.

The designated MEPS will a Coordinate with Military Services overseas ASVAB program managers b Provide applicant test data to USMEPCOM designated MEPS for reporting c Provide confirmation tests as appropriate and d Report test improprieties to USMEPCOM J3 Operations Testing Division. 4.3. THE DOD STUDENT TESTING PROGRAM. a. Program Description. 1 The DoD STP as outlined in DoDI 1304.12E is offered to provide students in secondary and postsecondary schools assistance in curriculum planning vocational and career counseling and group assessment. The DoD STP also known as the CEP provides names of potential recruits to the Military Services. 2 The ASVAB is a major component of the CEP. It has been shown to predict future occupational and academic success. 3 Specific forms of the ASVAB belong to the DoD STP. 4 The DoD offers the ASVAB program to schools at no cost. 5 The ASVAB results integrated with individual interest assessments and personal preferences enable students to explore suitable careers for themselves. It is also useful to the Services to identify students eligible for military service and assignment to military occupational training programs. Various options are available to permit or restrict recruiter contact with students after schools receive the scores. b. Testing Policy. DoDM 1145.02 July 23 2018 SECTION 4 APTITUDE STANDARDS 22 1 Testing in educational institutions with any form of the enlistment ASVAB including enlistment screening tests is prohibited per DoDI 1304.12E. However the results of the student ASVAB can be used for enlistment up to 2 years following the date of the test for 11th and 12th graders. Test results for 10th graders cannot be used for enlistment. Scores reported for students who take the student test while in an applicant status are invalid for enlistment. 2 The MEPS assigned responsibility for the school concerned will provide test materials to the school and will administer score and report the results of testing to the school. 3 The school participating in DoD STP testing will provide a suitable welllit and ventilated room that is free of extraneous noise and interruptions as well a 3 \u00bd hour block of time to conduct the test less time may be required if the tests are electronically administered. 4 Students in the 9th grade will not be tested. There are no nationally representative norms for this age group. If 9th grade students are inadvertently tested their answer sheets will be destroyed and not scored. 5 The recruiting Service and school administration will establish formal procedures to control the distribution access and retention of ASVAB data on individual students tested in the 11th and 12th grades. 6 Student scores will be provided to school counselors for use in programs that support educational and career counseling. 7 When discussing test results with students recruiting personnel will encourage students to graduate from High School before enlisting into a Military Service. 8 Information on an individual\u2019s identity and related test information will not be released to any agency outside of the student\u2019s school system and the DoD. 9 The IRC is responsible for proctor support. 10 Additional student testing policy and procedures are defined in USMEPCOM policies and procedures. 4.4.

SERVICE ASVAB TESTING PROGRAM. The Military Services are responsible for the Armed Forces Classification Test and the overseas ETP. a. Armed Forces Classification Test AFCT. 1 Program Description. a The AFCT is the inService test that evaluates individuals on the same aptitude areas as the enlistment ASVAB. b The AFCT like the ASVAB assesses aptitude for training and is a proven and valid predictor of success in initial entry training programs. c The AFCT will always be administered in its entirety. d The AFCT along with the inservice education job experience and training is useful to support personnel decisions on an individual\u2019s potential for advancement or specialized training. e As new ASVAB forms are introduced into the ETP no less than two forms of the predecessor enlistment ASVAB will be designated for an AFCT. f The OPA will recommend different forms or versions of the ASVAB for an AFCT to the MAPWG. The MAPWG will make a recommendation to approve or disapprove the OPA recommendation to the Director Accession Policy. DoDM 1145.02 July 23 2018 SECTION 4 APTITUDE STANDARDS 24 g Answer sheets administration instructions directions for scoring and scoring keys will carry the AFCT title. h The cover and numbering of the AFCT will be distinct from ASVAB identification. i The MAPWG must concur with any alteration to AFCT test booklets or test components. j The Military Service concerned is responsible for printing and reprinting all AFCT materials. k The MAPWG will determine procedures to print reprint and manage computerized versions of the AFCT to support the requirements of the Service concerned. 2 Testing Policy. a Each Military Service will establish policies procedures and responsibilities for administering their respective inservice testing programs for determining the qualification of individuals for inservice placement and programs. b The AFCT is administered only in its entirety all ASVAB subtests. c To ensure ASVAB security consistent with ASVAB policy only Service designated test control officers TCOs and TAs will handle AFCT materials. d The loss or compromise of a single AFCT test battery jeopardizes not only the AFCT but also more importantly the larger ASVAB testing program. Loss or compromise of test materials requires completion of an administrative investigation by the Military Service concerned. Such investigations will be submitted to the Director Accession Policy via the first general or flag officer in the Service\u2019s chain of command and via Commander USMEPCOM. The Military Services will issue appropriate policies to safeguard AFCT materials. The following are prohibited actions that constitute loss or compromise of test materials 1. Access to test by unauthorized personnel. 2. Discussion of test questions with unauthorized personnel. 3. Examinee revealing test questions to other Service members. 4. Questioning of examinees by anyone for the purpose of gaining knowledge of test contents. 5. Development of a local or practice test that contains actual test material. This includes coaching practices at the test center concerned utilizing locally developed test questions test aids or commercial test study guides to familiarize an individual with a test. 6.

New York MEPS will provide official student and enlistment ASVAB scoring support for the European Caribbean Central and South America and the Middle East areas. h Special purpose tests conducted for enlistment by overseas TCOs are processed through New York or Honolulu MEPS and scored results and answer sheets will be verified by MEPS test personnel and entered into USMIRS. i Additional guidance regarding ASVAB overseas testing is found in USMEPCOM policies and procedures and from the HQ USMEPCOM overseas testing program manager. 3 ETP. a The TCO or TA with the Service recruiter will ensure the original USMEPCOM 680\u20133A\u2013E Request for Examination is completed for each applicant before the administration of the enlistment test. b The TCO or TA will mail the following items to a designated MEPS within 48 hours after administering the enlistment test completed USMEPCOM Form 6803AE completed USMEPCOM Form 61117RE Aptitude Testing Processing List and DD Form DoDM 1145.02 July 23 2018 SECTION 4 APTITUDE STANDARDS 27 2AS Enlistment Answer Sheet a controlled document available through Service testing programs. c After administering the enlistment test the TCO or TA will compute the ASVAB AFQT using the personal digital assistant PDA and record results on the USMEPCOM Form 61112RE Unverified Test Scores computer generated form at MEPS. This form will be given to the overseas recruiter after the test. If the recruiter is not present at the test site after completion of the test the unverified test scores are given to the applicant in a sealed envelope addressed to the recruiter. 4 STP. a The Services ASVAB overseas program manager will coordinate annually with all DoDEA schools located overseas to schedule student testing. The Service of the base or installation commander is the responsible Service for ensuring student testing is administered. b Recruiting personnel may serve as proctors in student test sessions but are prohibited from performing any other duties while the test is being administered. c The TCO or TA will mail the following items to the designated MEPS within 48 hours after administering the student test USMEPCOM Form 60143RE Student Test Record and the DD Form 13045AS Student Answer Sheet a controlled document available through Service testing programs. 4.6. PROCESSING OF APPLICANT WITH NONQUALIFYING SCORES. An applicant tested at a MET site who fails to achieve the minimum requirements as established by the sponsoring Service will not be sent to the MEPS for further processing. If an applicant is in medical processing and the test scores reveal the applicant has not met Service standards the medical processing will continue to complete the medical examination process. 4.7. ASVAB RETESTING. a. Retest Policy for Enlistment and Student ASVAB. After taking an initial ASVAB an individual can retest 1 calendar month after the initial test 1 calendar month after the first retest and every 6 calendar months thereafter. 1 An applicant administered an ASVAB test within 2 years of any previous ASVAB test is considered to have received a retest. 2 An applicant who answers at least one ASVAB question is considered to have tested establishing retest eligibility. 3 The retest policy applies to any enlistment test taken and a student test when used for enlistment purposes. DoDM 1145.02 July 23 2018 SECTION 4 APTITUDE STANDARDS 28 4 When retested a complete ASVAB is administered and the results of a valid test become the applicant\u2019s score of record. 5 If an applicant is retested with the same test version within a 6month period or before the required time between previous test and retest the retest score will be invalidated and the previous test score will stand as the score of record. However if this condition is the result of a USMEPCOM clerical or administrative error an immediate retest using a different ASVAB version may be authorized by the MEPS commander. 6 Individuals in the DEP will not be retested except for inquiry into possible testing improprieties. If an individual is tested inadvertently while in the DEP the resulting test scores are invalid. b. Retest Functions for Enlistment and Student ASVAB. 1 The HQ USMEPCOM J3 Operations Testing Division can authorize MEPS commanders to retest for USMEPCOM not Service error for example instances where testing occurred under adverse conditions such as a fire evacuation. J3 may also authorize a retest when it is believed an individual\u2019s scores do not reflect his or her true ability. 2 The HQ USMEPCOM J3 Operations Testing Division can authorize MEPS commanders to retest an applicant who through no fault of the applicant is precluded from completing the test e.g. called away from the test session due to an emergency. This does not include illness that existed before the test session since the applicant is cautioned not to take the test if ill. 3 The MEPS commander may require an applicant to retest when the MEPS commander operations officer or TCOalternate TCO upon interviewing the applicant have reasonable cause to suspect improper means were employed to influence or inflate test scores. The retest will be taken at the MEPS. 4 If the results of a mandatory retest demonstrate that a testing impropriety occurred during the original test or if such impropriety is determined during an appropriate interview all associated retest results for that applicant will be invalidated and the individual will be prohibited from voluntary retesting for 6 months. When eligible to retest all retests must be taken in the MEPS. 5 When a Service errs in the application of established testing policy the MAPWG policy member from the Service concerned may request an exception to testing policy so that a retest can be administered. Both the Service MAPWG and USMEPCOM staff must concur that an exception is appropriate for recommendation to be forwarded to the MAPWG Chair for decision. 6 USMEPCOM will administer a mandatory confirmation retest when an applicant gains 20 or more AFQT percentile points. This gain is compared to the most recent valid test score received within the previous 6 months. Results of a confirmation test are not valid for enlistment. When a confirmation test is directed a complete ASVAB is administered. DoDM 1145.02 July 23 2018 SECTION 4 APTITUDE STANDARDS 29 Confirmation test results will be reviewed as outlined in USMEPCOM policies and procedures covering enlistment qualification test program. c. Retest Policy for InService Testing. 1 Each Service will implement policies and procedures for retesting on the AFCT. 2 Any exceptions to policy will be directed to the Service program manager concerned. 4.8. TEMPORARY IDENTIFICATION NUMBER TIN. To support the processing of applicants from countries with a Compact of Free Association as listed in Section 504c of Title 10 U.S.C. a USMEPCOM generated TIN may be assigned when an applicant is eligible to work in the United States but has not received a social security number SSN. Applicants processing on this assigned TIN may take the ASVAB medical examination and enlist into the DEP. Applicants may not access or ship until they are in possession of a valid SSN. 4.9. TEST SECURITY. a. Purpose. 1 The loss or other compromise of a single ASVAB test battery jeopardizes ASVAB predictive validity. 2 Each individual who takes either the student or enlistment ASVAB must be considered a potential accession. Inaccurate test scores may result in improper training classification assignment to training or other personnel action detrimental to the individual or the Military Service. 3 Each individual taking the AFCT is a Service member of the Military Service concerned. Inaccurate test scores may result in improper training classification assignment to training or other personnel action detrimental to the individual or the Military Service. b. Functions. 1 The MEPS is in charge of ASVAB test sessions in the United States and its territories. 2 In overseas areas the Service TCO is in charge of an ASVAB test session for the command or commander sponsoring the test. Each Military Service will provide to USMEPCOM a current list of its overseas TCOs authorized to administer student and enlistment ASVAB test versions. 3 A TCO is responsible for the overall testing program and exercises close supervision over all phases of test material receipt storage protection issue administration scoring and destruction. Duties include control and training of TAs and proctors and application of the highest levels of honesty integrity and professionalism in each test session. DoDM 1145.02 July 23 2018 SECTION 4 APTITUDE STANDARDS 30 4 Each TA and proctor is responsible to the TCO to ensure tests are scored and results recorded accurately proper testing procedures are followed test sessions are organized and that each individual has test materials is following instructions and receives answers to any questions concerning test procedures. 5 In the STP the applicant to proctor ratio will be no greater than 40 students to 1 proctor excluding the TA. 6 In the ETP the applicant to TA ratio will be no greater than 25 applicants to 1 TA. The MEPS commander is authorized to increase the ratio to 30 applicants to 1 TA provided adequate security and integrity of the test can be maintained for a test location that seats more than 25 applicants. When the test session size exceeds 30 applicants the applicant to TA ratio will not exceed 25 applicants to 1 TA a minimum of 2 TA is required. The ration of 25 to 1 cannot be exceeded. For example any test session involving between 50 and 75 applicants requires 3 TAs at a minimum if there are 76 applicants 4 TAs are required. 7 The TA determines the number of proctors needed in addition to the minimum requirement for each student test session. The proctor to student ratio must meet minimum requirement specified in Paragraph 4.9.b.5 of this issuance. Regardless of rank rate or grade the proctor is responsible to the TA. Each is responsible for preventing cheating during a test session. 8 During a test session only examinees TAs and designated proctors military or civilian personnel are permitted to handle test booklets. Only TAs shall handle CATASVAB diskettes and CDs and have access to CATASVAB passwords. 9 Recruiting personnel military or civilian are prohibited from admission to an enlistment test session. 10 Establishing a MET site in a recruiting station is prohibited. 4.10. ACCOUNTABLE TEST MATERIALS. a. Accountability. 1 Accountability to safeguard all controlled test components containing test questions or answers will be in effect at all times. 2 Accountable test items are test booklets cassettes CDs scoring keys CATASVAB computer disks special purpose testing software partially or fully completed answer sheets PDAs PDA memory modules and scratch paper with annotations used for ASVAB or special purpose test administration. Accountable items are marked with FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY or CONTROLLED ITEMS TEST MATERIALS or similar wording. 3 Nonaccountable items are blank answer sheets administration manuals and scoring worksheets.

Program Description.  \nDoDM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 4:  APTITUDE STANDARDS  \n18 \n(1)  The DoD Enlistment Testing Program (ETP) gives a sponsoring Service an \napplicant\u2019s aptitude and non-cognitive test results. \n(2)  The sponsoring Service will determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for enlistment. \n(3)  Specific parallel versions of the ASVAB are designated for use in the DoD ETP. \n(4)  The ASVAB scores are one of several criteria used to qualify individuals for \nenlistment and for placement into military occupations. \nb.  Testing Policy.  \n(1)  Enlistment qualification tests will not be administered to applicants who are \notherwise ineligible for enlistment. \n(2)  The recruiting Service is responsible for ensuring that the applicant meets basic \neligibility requirements to enlist before sponsoring an individual for MEPS or MET site ASVAB \ntesting. \n(3)  The USMEPCOM Form 680-3A-E \u201cRequest for Examination,\u201d available on the \nUSMEPCOM website, is required to authorize the applicant\u2019s enlistment qualification testing or \nretesting.  Accuracy of the data elements on the form is the responsibility of the applicant and the \nrecruiter.  The ASVAB will not be administered to any applicant unless a fully completed and \ncertified USMEPCOM Form 680-3A-E is presented before testing.   \n(4)  The enlistment ASVAB is solely for the testing of individuals specifically applying \nfor enlistment.  The enlistment ASVAB is not to test students in educational institutions. \n(5)  Testing applicants for enlistment with the ASVAB by other than MEPS-designated \npersonnel is not authorized, except utilizing the online un-proctored ASVAB or in overseas \nareas. \n(6)  The ASVAB scores are valid for enlistment purposes, including the DEP, for 2 years \nfrom the date of test administration.  In all cases, the most recent valid ASVAB score is the score \nof record and is the only score that can be used for enlistment processing purposes. \n(7)  To take the enlistment ASVAB, applicants must provide photographic identification \n(e.g., driver\u2019s license, student identification card, military dependent identification card, or \npassport) to the test administrator (TA).  Applicants without photographic identification will be \nrequired to have their right thumbprint imprinted on the USMEPCOM Form 680-3A-E.  \nApplicants without photographic identification and who refuse to render a thumbprint will be \ndenied the opportunity to test.   \n(8)  During processing, applicant signatures will be compared to ensure proper applicant \nidentification.  Locations operating with USMEPCOM identity management software do not \nrequire the applicant to present photographic identification or manually thumbprint an applicant \non USMEPCOM Form 680-3A-E before testing.  \nDoDM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 4:  APTITUDE STANDARDS  \n19 \n(9)  Personnel in the DEP will not retest with the enlistment or student ASVAB. \n(10)  The first ASVAB administered, whether in the enlistment or student program, is the \ninitial test of an applicant.  An exception is a test administered in the school testing program to a \nstudent in the 10th grade; this test cannot be used for enlistment purposes, and therefore it does \nnot count as a first test.  Any subsequent testing with the ASVAB, enlistment or student, within \n2 years of any previous test is considered a retest; retest policy is addressed in Paragraph 4.7 of \nthis issuance. \n(11)  An applicant who has answered at least one question on the ASVAB is considered \nto have tested. \n(12)  A TA is not authorized to test an individual who, in their judgment, appears to be \nunder the influence of alcohol or drugs. \n(13)  Under normal circumstances, the applicant\u2019s test results will only be provided to the \nsponsoring recruiting Service.  Test results will not be given directly to the applicant after \ntesting. \n(14)  Cameras, cellular telephones, or any other personal electronic devices are prohibited \nwithin any testing area. \n(15)  Applicants detected receiving or using unauthorized assistance (e.g., unauthorized \nnotes or study questions, talking during the test, or gazing onto a neighbor\u2019s test), or committing \nother inappropriate conduct (e.g., working on a portion of the test other than the one being \nadministered, or using a calculator, slide rule, cellular telephone, electronic translator, or other \nmechanical device) will not be allowed to continue to test.  If testing is complete, their test \nresults will be invalidated. \n(16)  Applicants leaving the test room without authorization will have their test results \ninvalidated. \n(17)  In all cases where a test is invalidated, the individual will be prohibited from further \ntesting for 6 calendar months.  Additionally, results of an invalidated test cannot be used for \nenlistment purposes. \n(18)  In addition to administering the ASVAB, MEPS personnel are authorized to \nadminister approved special purpose tests.  Special purpose testing will not be scheduled or \nconducted in a manner that impairs the ability of the MEPS concerned to complete enlistment or \nstudent testing missions.  \u201cSpecial Purpose Testing\u201d is explained in Paragraph 4.4 of this \nissuance. \n(19)  The MEPS TA will not administer the ASVAB to other personnel (military or \ncivilian) assigned to the same MEPS. \n(20)  At paper-and-pencil MET sites, only the unverified Armed Forces Qualification \nTest (AFQT) score may be released to the sponsoring recruiting Service.  At CAT-ASVAB MET \nDoDM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 4:  APTITUDE STANDARDS  \n20 \nsites, all scores on the CAT-ASVAB unverified score report may be released to the sponsoring \nrecruiting Service. \n(21)  MEPS and recruiting personnel may not use ASVAB tests, locally developed test \nquestions, test aids, or commercial study guides to familiarize applicants or potential applicant \nwith the ASVAB.  Applicants may be advised that commercial study guides are available; \nhowever, commercial study guides will not be maintained in any MEPS or MET site facility, or \nin the possession of MEPS and recruiting personnel for use by applicants.  The MEPS and \nrecruiting personnel will not participate in applicant study preparation, nor provide or \nrecommend actions that would afford an applicant with an unfair advantage towards improving \nASVAB scores.  The TAs will report anyone seeking inappropriate testing assistance to the \nMEPS commander. \nc.  MET Site   \n(1)  Management.  HQ USMEPCOM and local MEPS policies and procedures, in \nconjunction with the IRC, outline the management of USMEPCOM processing location MET \nsites.  USMEPCOM will manage the proctor ratio to ensure approved testing can be completed. \n(2)  MET Site Facilities. \n(a)  MET site facilities located outside of the MEPS, intended to be used for the \naptitude testing of applicants, will be designated by the MEPS commander after coordination \nwith voting and nonvoting members of the IRC, in accordance with policies and procedures \nprescribed by HQ USMEPCOM.  The function for locating, identifying, and coordinating the use \nof facilities outside the MEPS will be shared by all members of the IRC. \n(b)  Procedures for the administration and protection of enlistment aptitude tests and \ncomputer equipment are prescribed in USMEPCOM policies and procedures, which are \napplicable to all military recruiting Services, MEPS, and users of MEPS facilities, including \nMET sites. \n(c)  Provisions of travel for applicants to and from USMEPCOM processing location \ntest sites is the responsibility of the recruiting Services.  This includes providing meals. \n(d)  In accordance with USMEPCOM policies and procedures, the following facility \nrequirements will be met when administering an aptitude test.   \n1.  Desks or tables with writing surfaces that are flat and smooth and wide enough \nto accommodate the test and answer sheets;   \n2.  Chairs will not have writing arms;   \n3.  Test rooms will have proper illumination, ventilation, and be temperature \ncontrolled.  They will also be free from noise and visual distractions; and,   \n4.

THE DOD STUDENT TESTING PROGRAM.  \na.  Program Description.  \n(1)  The DoD STP, as outlined in DoDI 1304.12E, is offered to provide students in \nsecondary and post-secondary schools assistance in curriculum planning, vocational and career \ncounseling, and group assessment.  The DoD STP, also known as the CEP, provides names of \npotential recruits to the Military Services. \n(2)  The ASVAB is a major component of the CEP.  It has been shown to predict future \noccupational and academic success. \n(3)  Specific forms of the ASVAB belong to the DoD STP. \n(4)  The DoD offers the ASVAB program to schools at no cost. \n(5)  The ASVAB results, integrated with individual interest assessments and personal \npreferences, enable students to explore suitable careers for themselves.  It is also useful to the \nServices to identify students eligible for military service and assignment to military occupational \ntraining programs.  Various options are available to permit or restrict recruiter contact with \nstudents after schools receive the scores. \nb.  Testing Policy.  \nDoDM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 4:  APTITUDE STANDARDS  \n22 \n(1)  Testing in educational institutions with any form of the enlistment ASVAB, \nincluding enlistment screening tests, is prohibited per DoDI 1304.12E.  However, the results of \nthe student ASVAB can be used for enlistment up to 2 years following the date of the test for \n11th and 12th graders.  Test results for 10th graders cannot be used for enlistment.  Scores \nreported for students who take the student test while in an applicant status are invalid for \nenlistment. \n(2)  The MEPS assigned responsibility for the school concerned will provide test \nmaterials to the school, and will administer, score, and report the results of testing to the school. \n(3)  The school participating in DoD STP testing will provide a suitable well-lit and \nventilated room that is free of extraneous noise and interruptions, as well a 3 \u00bd hour block of \ntime to conduct the test; less time may be required if the tests are electronically administered. \n(4)  Students in the 9th grade will not be tested.  There are no nationally representative \nnorms for this age group.  If 9th grade students are inadvertently tested, their answer sheets will \nbe destroyed and not scored. \n(5)  The recruiting Service and school administration will establish formal procedures to \ncontrol the distribution, access, and retention of ASVAB data on individual students tested in the \n11th and 12th grades. \n(6)  Student scores will be provided to school counselors for use in programs that support \neducational and career counseling. \n(7)  When discussing test results with students, recruiting personnel will encourage \nstudents to graduate from High School before enlisting into a Military Service. \n(8)  Information on an individual\u2019s identity and related test information will not be \nreleased to any agency outside of the student\u2019s school system and the DoD. \n(9)  The IRC is responsible for proctor support. \n(10)  Additional student testing policy and procedures are defined in USMEPCOM \npolicies and procedures. \n4.4.  SPECIAL PURPOSE TESTING.  Special purpose tests are administered at the request of \nthe Service concerned to determine the qualification of an applicant for specific occupational \nspecialties or special enlistment programs.  MEPS are authorized to administer the tests listed \nbelow and additional tests as recommended by the MAPWG and approved by Director, \nAccession Policy. \na.  Authorized Test.  Special purpose tests will only be administered to an applicant when \nauthorized by the Service concerned. \nb.  Special Tests.  The following tests will be administered in accordance with approved \npolicies and procedures of the Commander, USMEPCOM.   \nDoDM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 4:  APTITUDE STANDARDS  \n23 \n(1)  Air Force Officer Qualifying Test. \n(2)  Coding Speed (Navy only). \n(3)  Cyber Test, also known as CT. \n(4)  Defense Language Proficiency Test, also known as DLPT. \n(5)  Defense Language Aptitude Battery, also known as DLAB. \n(6)  Electronic Data Processing Test, also known as EDPT.  \n(7)  English Comprehension Level Test, also known as ECLT. \n(8)  Selective Instrument Flight Training Test, also known as SIFT. \n(9)  Tailored Adaptive Personality Assessment System, also known as TAPAS. \n(10)  Test of Basic Aviation Skills, also known as TBAS. \n(11)  Work Preference Assessment, also known as WPA. \n4.5.  SERVICE ASVAB TESTING PROGRAM.  The Military Services are responsible for the \nArmed Forces Classification Test and the overseas ETP.   \na.  Armed Forces Classification Test (AFCT).  \n(1)  Program Description. \n(a)  The AFCT is the in-Service test that evaluates individuals on the same aptitude \nareas as the enlistment ASVAB. \n(b)  The AFCT, like the ASVAB, assesses aptitude for training and is a proven and \nvalid predictor of success in initial entry training programs. \n(c)  The AFCT will always be administered in its entirety. \n(d)  The AFCT, along with the in-service education, job experience and training, is \nuseful to support personnel decisions on an individual\u2019s potential for advancement or specialized \ntraining. \n(e)  As new ASVAB forms are introduced into the ETP, no less than two forms of the \npredecessor enlistment ASVAB will be designated for an AFCT. \n(f)  The OPA will recommend different forms or versions of the ASVAB for an \nAFCT to the MAPWG.  The MAPWG will make a recommendation to approve or disapprove \nthe OPA recommendation to the Director, Accession Policy. \nDoDM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 4:  APTITUDE STANDARDS  \n24 \n(g)  Answer sheets, administration instructions, directions for scoring, and scoring \nkeys, will carry the AFCT title. \n(h)  The cover and numbering of the AFCT will be distinct from ASVAB \nidentification. \n(i)  The MAPWG must concur with any alteration to AFCT test booklets or test \ncomponents. \n(j)  The Military Service concerned is responsible for printing and reprinting all \nAFCT materials.  \n(k)  The MAPWG will determine procedures to print, reprint, and manage \ncomputerized versions of the AFCT to support the requirements of the Service concerned. \n(2)  Testing Policy. \n(a)  Each Military Service will establish policies, procedures, and responsibilities for \nadministering their respective in-service testing programs for determining the qualification of \nindividuals for in-service placement and programs.  \n(b)  The AFCT is administered only in its entirety (all ASVAB subtests). \n(c)  To ensure ASVAB security, consistent with ASVAB policy, only Service-\ndesignated test control officers (TCOs) and TAs will handle AFCT materials. \n(d)  The loss or compromise of a single AFCT test battery jeopardizes not only the \nAFCT, but also more importantly, the larger ASVAB testing program.  Loss or compromise of \ntest materials requires completion of an administrative investigation by the Military Service \nconcerned.  Such investigations will be submitted to the Director, Accession Policy, via the first \ngeneral or flag officer in the Service\u2019s chain of command and via Commander, USMEPCOM.  \nThe Military Services will issue appropriate policies to safeguard AFCT materials.  The \nfollowing are prohibited actions that constitute loss or compromise of test materials: \n1.  Access to test by unauthorized personnel. \n2.  Discussion of test questions with unauthorized personnel. \n3.  Examinee revealing test questions to other Service members. \n4.  Questioning of examinees by anyone for the purpose of gaining knowledge of \ntest contents. \n5.  Development of a local or practice test that contains actual test material.  This \nincludes coaching practices at the test center concerned utilizing locally developed test questions, \ntest aids, or commercial test study guides to familiarize an individual with a test. \n6.  Reproduction of any test materials in whole or in part. \nDoDM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 4:  APTITUDE STANDARDS  \n25 \n7.  Removal of test material by an examinee from the test room. \n8.  Leaving examinees unsupervised during a test session. \n9.  Failure to account for accountable test material at any time. \n10.  Transfer of accountable test material without proper receipt. \n11.

Tampering with any package containing test material. \n15.  Improper storage of test material. \n16.  Access by unauthorized personnel to any safe or secured container containing \ntest material. \n17.  Theft of test material by any individual. \n18.  Use of unauthorized notes, study questions, or an unauthorized testing aid. \n(e)  Each Service testing program will notify its Service MAPWG member of any \ninstance of compromise or possible compromise of accountable and controlled material. \n(f)  The Service MAPWG member will immediately report by memorandum all instances \nof actual test loss or possible compromise of accountable and controlled material to the Chair, \nPolicy Committee.  At a minimum, the memorandum will include test site location and date, \npurpose and size of session, circumstances surrounding incident, action taken to investigate, \nprojected time to complete investigation, and action regarding continued use of lost or \ncompromised test version.  Upon completion of the investigation required by Paragraph \n4.5.b.(2)(d) of this issuance, a final report will be submitted to the Policy Committee that \nincludes corrective action taken to prevent recurrence.  A vote by the Policy Committee will \ndetermine whether the Service concerned will continue to use the test version in its in-service \ntesting program. \nb.  Overseas Testing Program. \n(1)  Program Description. \n(a)  The overseas testing program provides student and enlistment ASVAB testing for \npersons residing outside of the United States. \n(b)  The Military Services are responsible for operation of the overseas testing \nprogram, except for testing in U.S. territories which is the responsibility of USMEPCOM. \nDoDM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 4:  APTITUDE STANDARDS  \n26 \n(c)  Each Service MAPWG representative will identify an ASVAB overseas program \nmanager for their respective Service to provide close coordination with USMEPCOM J3 \nOperations Testing Division. \n(2)  Policy. \n(a)  Appointment orders must be issued authorizing the test examiner to administer \nboth the student and enlistment ASVAB.  TCO appointment orders are to be signed by the test \nexaminer\u2019s commander and maintained on file by the Service ASVAB overseas program \nmanager. \n(b)  The ASVAB will always be administered in its entirety. \n(c)  The ASVAB test will be administered and mailed only by an authorized TCO or \nTA. \n(d)  Overseas Services TCOs or TAs will administer the student and enlistment \nASVAB in accordance with the appropriate manual for the administration of the enlistment or \nstudent versions of the test. \n(e)  Enlistment tests will be scored and processed through the USMEPCOM \nIntegrated Resource System (USMIRS) within 3 working days of receipt. \n(f)  Student tests given at Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) \nschools will be scored and processed through USMIRS, and all CEP related results mailed to the \nrespective school within 14 days of receipt. \n(g)  Honolulu MEPS will provide official student and enlistment ASVAB scoring \nsupport for the Pacific and Far East areas.  New York MEPS will provide official student and \nenlistment ASVAB scoring support for the European, Caribbean, Central and South America, \nand the Middle East areas. \n(h)  Special purpose tests conducted for enlistment by overseas TCOs are processed \nthrough New York or Honolulu MEPS and scored results and answer sheets will be verified by \nMEPS test personnel and entered into USMIRS. \n(i)  Additional guidance regarding ASVAB overseas testing is found in USMEPCOM \npolicies and procedures and from the HQ USMEPCOM overseas testing program manager. \n(3)  ETP. \n(a)  The TCO or TA, with the Service recruiter, will ensure the original USMEPCOM \n680\u20133A\u2013E (Request for Examination) is completed for each applicant before the administration \nof the enlistment test. \n(b)  The TCO or TA will mail the following items to a designated MEPS within \n48 hours after administering the enlistment test: completed USMEPCOM Form 680-3A-E; \ncompleted USMEPCOM Form 611-1-7-R-E, \u201cAptitude Testing Processing List;\u201d and DD Form \nDoDM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 4:  APTITUDE STANDARDS  \n27 \n2AS, \u201cEnlistment Answer Sheet,\u201d a controlled document available through Service testing \nprograms. \n(c)  After administering the enlistment test, the TCO or TA will compute the ASVAB \nAFQT using the personal digital assistant (PDA) and record results on the USMEPCOM Form \n611-1-2-R-E, \u201cUnverified Test Scores,\u201d computer generated form at MEPS.  This form will be \ngiven to the overseas recruiter after the test.  If the recruiter is not present at the test site after \ncompletion of the test, the unverified test scores are given to the applicant in a sealed envelope \naddressed to the recruiter. \n(4)  STP. \n(a)  The Services ASVAB overseas program manager will coordinate annually with \nall DoDEA schools located overseas to schedule student testing.  The Service of the base or \ninstallation commander is the responsible Service for ensuring student testing is administered. \n(b)  Recruiting personnel may serve as proctors in student test sessions, but are \nprohibited from performing any other duties while the test is being administered. \n(c)  The TCO or TA will mail the following items to the designated MEPS within 48 \nhours after administering the student test: USMEPCOM Form 601-4-3-R-E, \u201cStudent Test \nRecord\u201d and the DD Form 1304-5AS, \u201cStudent Answer Sheet,\u201d a controlled document available \nthrough Service testing programs. \n4.6.  PROCESSING OF APPLICANT WITH NON-QUALIFYING SCORES.  An applicant \ntested at a MET site who fails to achieve the minimum requirements as established by the \nsponsoring Service will not be sent to the MEPS for further processing.  If an applicant is in \nmedical processing and the test scores reveal the applicant has not met Service standards, the \nmedical processing will continue to complete the medical examination process.   \n4.7.  ASVAB RETESTING. \na.  Retest Policy for Enlistment and Student ASVAB.  After taking an initial ASVAB, an \nindividual can retest 1 calendar month after the initial test, 1 calendar month after the first retest, \nand every 6 calendar months thereafter. \n(1)  An applicant administered an ASVAB test within 2 years of any previous ASVAB \ntest is considered to have received a retest. \n(2)  An applicant who answers at least one ASVAB question is considered to have tested, \nestablishing retest eligibility. \n(3)  The retest policy applies to any enlistment test taken and a student test when used for \nenlistment purposes.   \nDoDM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 4:  APTITUDE STANDARDS  \n28 \n(4)  When retested, a complete ASVAB is administered and the results of a valid test \nbecome the applicant\u2019s score of record. \n(5)  If an applicant is retested with the same test version within a 6-month period or \nbefore the required time between previous test and retest, the retest score will be invalidated and \nthe previous test score will stand as the score of record.  However, if this condition is the result \nof a USMEPCOM clerical or administrative error, an immediate retest using a different ASVAB \nversion may be authorized by the MEPS commander. \n(6)  Individuals in the DEP will not be retested except for inquiry into possible testing \nimproprieties.  If an individual is tested inadvertently while in the DEP, the resulting test scores \nare invalid. \nb.  Retest Functions for Enlistment and Student ASVAB. \n(1)  The HQ USMEPCOM, J3 Operations Testing Division, can authorize MEPS \ncommanders to retest for USMEPCOM (not Service) error, for example, instances where testing \noccurred under adverse conditions such as a fire evacuation.  J3 may also authorize a retest when \nit is believed an individual\u2019s scores do not reflect his or her true ability. \n(2)  The HQ USMEPCOM, J3 Operations Testing Division, can authorize MEPS \ncommanders to retest an applicant who, through no fault of the applicant, is precluded from \ncompleting the test (e.g., called away from the test session due to an emergency).  This does not \ninclude illness that existed before the test session since the applicant is cautioned not to take the \ntest if ill. \n(3)  The MEPS commander may require an applicant to retest when the MEPS \ncommander, operations officer, or TCO/alternate TCO, upon interviewing the applicant, have \nreasonable cause to suspect improper means were employed to influence or inflate test scores.  \nThe retest will be taken at the MEPS. \n(4)  If the results of a mandatory retest demonstrate that a testing impropriety occurred \nduring the original test, or if such impropriety is determined during an appropriate interview, all \nassociated retest results for that applicant will be invalidated, and the individual will be \nprohibited from voluntary re-testing for 6 months.  When eligible to retest, all retests must be \ntaken in the MEPS. \n(5)  When a Service errs in the application of established testing policy, the MAPWG \npolicy member from the Service concerned may request an exception to testing policy so that a \nretest can be administered.  Both the Service MAPWG and USMEPCOM staff must concur that \nan exception is appropriate for recommendation to be forwarded to the MAPWG Chair for \ndecision. \n(6)  USMEPCOM will administer a mandatory confirmation retest when an applicant \ngains 20 or more AFQT percentile points.  This gain is compared to the most recent valid test \nscore received within the previous 6 months.  Results of a confirmation test are not valid for \nenlistment.  When a confirmation test is directed, a complete ASVAB is administered.  \nDoDM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 4:  APTITUDE STANDARDS  \n29 \nConfirmation test results will be reviewed as outlined in USMEPCOM policies and procedures \ncovering enlistment qualification test program.  \nc.  Retest Policy for In-Service Testing. \n(1)  Each Service will implement policies and procedures for retesting on the AFCT. \n(2)  Any exceptions to policy will be directed to the Service program manager concerned. \n4.8.  TEMPORARY IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (TIN).  To support the processing of \napplicants from countries with a Compact of Free Association, as listed in Section 504(c) of Title \n10, U.S.C., a USMEPCOM generated TIN may be assigned when an applicant is eligible to work \nin the United States but has not received a social security number (SSN).  Applicants processing \non this assigned TIN may take the ASVAB, medical examination, and enlist into the DEP.  \nApplicants may not access or ship until they are in possession of a valid SSN. \n4.9.  TEST SECURITY. \na.  Purpose. \n(1)  The loss or other compromise of a single ASVAB test battery jeopardizes ASVAB \npredictive validity. \n(2)  Each individual who takes either the student or enlistment ASVAB must be \nconsidered a potential accession.  Inaccurate test scores may result in improper training, \nclassification, assignment to training, or other personnel action detrimental to the individual or \nthe Military Service. \n(3)  Each individual taking the AFCT is a Service member of the Military Service \nconcerned.  Inaccurate test scores may result in improper training, classification, assignment to \ntraining, or other personnel action detrimental to the individual or the Military Service.   \nb.  Functions. \n(1)  The MEPS is in charge of ASVAB test sessions in the United States and its \nterritories. \n(2)  In overseas areas, the Service TCO is in charge of an ASVAB test session for the \ncommand or commander sponsoring the test.  Each Military Service will provide to \nUSMEPCOM a current list of its overseas TCOs authorized to administer student and enlistment \nASVAB test versions. \n(3)  A TCO is responsible for the overall testing program and exercises close supervision \nover all phases of test material receipt, storage, protection, issue, administration, scoring and \ndestruction.  Duties include control and training of TAs and proctors, and application of the \nhighest levels of honesty, integrity, and professionalism in each test session. \nDoDM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 4:  APTITUDE STANDARDS  \n30 \n(4)  Each TA and proctor is responsible to the TCO to ensure tests are scored and results \nrecorded accurately, proper testing procedures are followed, test sessions are organized, and that \neach individual has test materials, is following instructions, and receives answers to any \nquestions concerning test procedures. \n(5)  In the STP, the applicant to proctor ratio will be no greater than 40 students to 1 \nproctor, excluding the TA.  \n(6)  In the ETP, the applicant to TA ratio will be no greater than 25 applicants to 1 TA.  \nThe MEPS commander is authorized to increase the ratio to 30 applicants to 1 TA, provided \nadequate security and integrity of the test can be maintained, for a test location that seats more \nthan 25 applicants.  When the test session size exceeds 30 applicants, the applicant to TA ratio \nwill not exceed 25 applicants to 1 TA, a minimum of 2 TA is required.  The ration of 25 to 1 \ncannot be exceeded.  For example, any test session involving between 50 and 75 applicants \nrequires 3 TAs at a minimum, if there are 76 applicants 4 TAs are required.  \n(7)  The TA determines the number of proctors needed in addition to the minimum \nrequirement for each student test session.  The proctor to student ratio must meet minimum \nrequirement specified in Paragraph 4.9.b.5 of this issuance.  Regardless of rank, rate, or grade, \nthe proctor is responsible to the TA.  Each is responsible for preventing cheating during a test \nsession. \n(8)  During a test session, only examinees, TAs and designated proctors (military or \ncivilian personnel), are permitted to handle test booklets.  Only TAs shall handle CAT-ASVAB \ndiskettes and CDs and have access to CAT-ASVAB passwords. \n(9)  Recruiting personnel (military or civilian) are prohibited from admission to an \nenlistment test session. \n(10)  Establishing a MET site in a recruiting station is prohibited. \n4.10.  ACCOUNTABLE TEST MATERIALS. \na.  Accountability. \n(1)  Accountability to safeguard all controlled test components containing test questions \nor answers will be in effect at all times. \n(2)  Accountable test items are: test booklets, cassettes, CDs, scoring keys, CAT-ASVAB \ncomputer disks, special purpose testing software, partially or fully completed answer sheets, \nPDAs, PDA memory modules, and scratch paper with annotations used for ASVAB or special \npurpose test administration.  Accountable items are marked with \u201cFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\u201d \nor \u201cCONTROLLED ITEMS (TEST MATERIALS)\u201d or similar wording. \n(3)  Non-accountable items are blank answer sheets, administration manuals and scoring \nworksheets.  \nDoDM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 4:  APTITUDE STANDARDS  \n31 \nb.  Functions. \n(1)  USMEPCOM is responsible for the requisition, storage, issue, security, and \nmaintenance of appropriate stock levels of materials for the DoD STP and DoD ETP at MEPS, \nand MET sites. \n(2)  For overseas testing, the service designated TCO is the ASVAB TCO and is \nresponsible for the requisition, storage, issue, security, and maintenance of appropriate stock \nlevels of all test materials required for the DoD student and ETPs. \n(3)  Upon completion of any test session, an inventory and accounting of all test materials \nwill be conducted. \n(4)  Neither controlled testing material nor information extracted or derived from them \nmay be released or provided to any individual or agency not otherwise authorized such access.  \nRequests for an exception to this policy will be submitted in writing and through the chain of \ncommand, via Commander, USMEPCOM, to the Office of the USD(P&R), Attn: Accession \nPolicy, 1500 Defense Pentagon, Washington, D.C. 20301-1500.

The MEPS commander may, in consultation with the CMO, authorize medical \nreexamination when findings reflected on a previous DD Form 2808, DD Form 2807-1, or DD \nForm 2807-2 are inconsistent or in conflict with findings noted during the physical inspection. \nPortions of the examination may need to be repeated by USMEPCOM Command Surgeon or re-\nevaluated as appropriate.   \n(r)  Doubtful Medical Fitness Cases.  Final determination of an applicant\u2019s medical \nfitness for military service will normally be made by a USMEPCOM physician on the basis of \nthe examination conducted at the MEPS or off-station location.  Whenever there is doubt as to \nwhether or not an applicant meets the minimum medical requirements for military service, \ndetermination of acceptability can be made by the USMEPCOM Command surgeon or other HQ \nUSMEPCOM physician pursuant to USMEPCOM policy.  The final determination will be \nrecorded in applicant qualification fields of the DD Form 2808 with proper authentication. \nDoDM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 6:  ENLISTED STANDARDS \n40 \nSECTION 6:  ENLISTMENT STANDARDS \n6.1.

Consideration will be \ngiven to available RTR, reception processing, and training and school start schedules. \n(2)  The RTRs issued by the DTMO, in coordination with each MEPS, will govern the \ntravel of enlistees to initial duty stations.  The RTR prescribes the mode of transportation, carrier, \ntime, and route for repeated travel between two points.  Enlistee transportation from MEPS \nlocations to assigned duty stations typically utilizes commercial bus or a combination of \ncommercial bus and air carriers. \n(3)  Enlistee travel will not be scheduled between 2400 and 0600 hours.  RTRs will be \narranged for the enlistees so that any wait at a transportation terminal will not exceed 3 hours, \nwhenever possible. \n(4)  The mode of transportation specified in the RTR will be the most economical among \nthe available routings and within the time constraints in Paragraph 6.2.b(3) of this issuance.  The \ncost of delay in commencing travel (including meals, lodging, lost productive time, and \nnecessary expenses enroute) are factors to be added to the basic fare in comparing the economy \nof various modes. \n(5)  Although overnight travel should be utilized only on rare occasions, an enlistee \ntraveling overnight by rail will be provided sleeping accommodations.  Overnight travel by air or \nbus will not be used without authorization from HQ USMEPCOM Operations Director.  \nHowever, local problems, which arise during processing, remain the prerogative of the MEPS \ncommander to solve on an as needed basis. \n(6)  The recruit assistance program assists recruits during each step of their travel, from \narranging onward transport in the case of airline delays or cancellations, providing directions, \ncoordinating with Service organizations like the USO or YMCA, to providing assistance with \nlodging, meals, or simply moral support, so that an enlistee's or recruit\u2019s first military travel \nexperience is a positive one.  The program is supported by the travel assistance center.  \n \nDoDM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 7:  ACCESSION COMMUNITY OF INTEREST COMMITTEES \n46 \nSECTION 7:  ACCESSION COMMUNITY OF INTEREST COMMITTEES \n7.1.
