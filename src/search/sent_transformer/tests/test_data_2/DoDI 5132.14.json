Department of Defense AME will be consistent with U.S. Government and international standards and best practices. b. Department of Defense will maintain a hybrid approach to management of AME efforts whereby in general assessment and monitoring will be a decentralized effort based on the principles and guidelines established in this instruction and other directives policies and law and evaluations at the strategic level will be centralized and overseen by the USDP. c. When possible Department of Defense should align its AME efforts with those of host nation counterparts other donors and implementing partners. This should lessen the overall data collection burden and help promote security cooperation effectiveness. d. Assessment monitoring and evaluation each serve a separate function at distinct points in the security cooperation planning and implementation cycle see Figure 1. e. AME is required for all significant security cooperation initiatives. Such initiatives are generally led by the geographic combatant commanders and are often articulated as specific lines of effort in the country specific security cooperation sections of a theater campaign plan. Significant security cooperation initiatives involve the application of multiple security cooperation tools and programs which may be overseen and managed by various Department of Defense Components and the Department of State over multiple years to realize a country or regionspecific objective or functional objective e.g. maritime security or counterterrorism. f. Initiatives specifically designated as pilot programs i.e. testing new concepts and approaches to security cooperation to assess their effectiveness and applicability to broader requirements should be appropriately planned designed monitored and evaluated before being replicated or expanded. g. Accountability and learning are the primary purposes of AME and will shape efforts to leverage security cooperation more effectively in support of defense objectives in the near medium and long terms. AME indicates returns on investment allows policymakers to identify and improve or eliminate ineffective initiatives and provides credible information in support of policy and legislation. AME will help Department of Defense understand what security cooperation methods work and why and apply lessons learned and best practices to inform security cooperation resources and policy decisions. Department of DefenseI 5132.14 January 13 2017 SECTION 3. AME FRAMEWORK AND STANDARDS 13 Figure 1. AME Framework 3.2. INITIAL ASSESSMENT STANDARDS. Initial assessments are required before all significant security cooperation initiatives to inform IDDs and are encouraged before all security cooperation activities. The initial assessment provides an understanding of the context conditions partner capabilities and requirements to inform security cooperation planning and implementation. Assessments identify potential risks to initiative success to help planners develop riskmitigation strategies. a. Initial assessments describe host nation willingness and propensity to implement and sustain assistance improve institutional capacity and build capabilities in the context of country or other relevant objectives and to identify requirements gaps and potential risks. b. Analysis derived from an initial assessment should directly inform an IDD and related country plans in appropriate sections. Initial assessments should include the following elements 1 The extent to which an allied or partner nation shares relevant strategic objectives with the United States as well as a partner\u2019s current ability to contribute to missions to address Department of DefenseI 5132.14 January 13 2017 SECTION 3. AME FRAMEWORK AND STANDARDS 14 such shared objectives based on detailed holistic analysis of relevant partner capabilities such as through application of the doctrine organizational structure training materiel leadership and education personnel facilities and policy framework referenced in the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System as established by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01I. 2 Analysis of potential risks including assumptions and possible consequences of implementing and not implementing the initiative program or activity. 3 Information to inform initiative design including available contextual data baselines suggested objectives indicators and milestones as well as recommendations on what can be achieved within a given timeframe with anticipated resources. 4 Analysis of relevant environmental economic political sociological cultural and other conditions that may directly impact the implementation of the initiative in a specific country. 5 The feasibility of achieving successful outcomes based on a partner\u2019s political willingness to pursue the desired outcome its absorptive capacity including the extent to which a partner can support employ and sustain assistance independently its political stability and its respect for rule of law and human rights. 6 Analysis of other related U.S. Government nongovernmental and international government organizations and other stakeholder efforts that are underway or planned including how the security cooperation initiative may complement or compete with other programs or activities. 7 Other relevant information assessments completed evaluations and related documents that provide context for the initial assessment process. 3.3. SECURITY COOPERATION IDD STANDARDS. An IDD is required of all significant security cooperation initiatives. The IDD should be developed through a deliberate and inclusive process informed by the opportunities and risks identified in the initial assessment to create a comprehensive document. In many cases consulting the host nation can be helpful in the development of the IDD. a. The IDD should increase the likelihood that security cooperation investments are targeted measurable and effectively implemented. To that end it provides an overview of the activities and authorities to be applied in a synchronized manner to achieve the planned security cooperation outcome. Specifically IDDs should include 1 Clear linkage to goals or objectives in the theater campaign plan or other higherlevel guidance. 2 Problem statement derived from the initial assessment which is a clear description of the issue or challenge the initiative seeks to address. Also known as the rationale the problem statement provides the basis and reasons for implementing a security cooperation initiative. Department of DefenseI 5132.14 January 13 2017 SECTION 3.

The logic framework visually describes activities and the planned process of contributing to initiative goals and achieving objectives. b Indicators and milestones ideally with baselines and targets tied to the specific measureable achievable relevantresultsoriented and timebound objectives that quantitatively or qualitatively measure the outputs and outcomes of the security cooperation initiative toward achieving stated objectives. c A theory of change intended to make implicit assumptions more explicit which describes why certain actions will produce a desired change in a given context and clearly states what the intended outcome of the initiative will be and how it will be achieved. 4 Guidance to relevant stakeholders on how their security cooperation tools and activities should contribute to the security cooperation initiative and expectations regarding their role in supporting AME efforts. It should also include datacollection details parameters frequency and responsibility how results will be used and communicated and recommendations on when to evaluate the program. b. IDDs should be updated as circumstances change maintained and retained by the relevant Department of Defense Component and shared among initiative and AME stakeholders. 3.4. PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING STANDARDS. Performance monitoring for security cooperation will vary depending on the initiative or activity. Parameters and expectations for monitoring of indicators or milestones at predetermined intervals throughout implementation should be clearly outlined in the performance management section of the IDD. a. Monitoring may be focused at different levels such as 1 Output monitoring at the implementation level of specific deliverables such as goods and services to document progress during initiative implementation e.g. number of training events delivered. Output monitoring may be particularly useful to program managers and implementers. 2 Outcome monitoring at the leadership or management level of the results of security cooperation initiatives e.g. was capacity built based on our training Did the partner nation successfully employ the Department of Defenseprovided system in support of the intended mission. Outcome monitoring may be particularly useful to geographic combatant commanders and organizations with policy oversight and management responsibilities. b. Department of Defense will rely on existing data collection processes managed by Defense Security Cooperation Agency the geographic combatant commanders and other Department of Defense Components for all security cooperation activities. Data collected for each indicator should be organized in a systematic way to facilitate analysis and tracking trends to support Department of DefenseI 5132.14 January 13 2017 SECTION 3. AME FRAMEWORK AND STANDARDS 16 programmanagement decisions. Although data should be reported at planned intervals it may be modified to reflect the situation on the ground. c. Monitoring which also may include site visits should also review and identify any changes in the operational and strategic environment since the initial assessment and identify any unforeseen challenges that impact initiative execution and implementation. 3.5. EVALUATION STANDARDS. a. The USDP will maintain an office responsible for leading a centralized effort for independent evaluations to measure the effectiveness and impact of significant security cooperation initiatives toward meeting expected outcomes. Evaluations will be primarily conducted at the strategic level using the appropriate methodology based on context available resources and data. Standards for evaluations will be based on the American Evaluation Association and the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The four principles in Paragraphs 3.5.a. 1 through 4 should be incorporated into all evaluations conducted by Department of Defense. 1 Usefulness The information ideas and recommendations generated by evaluations should serve a need or answer specific strategic questions for Department of Defense. 2 Independence Evaluators should be able to gather and analyze data and information freely and follow rigorous and scientifically valid methodologies. All evaluations should be free from any interference from the commissioning unit or management. 3 Methodological and Analytical Rigor Evaluations should be evidencebased relying on verifiable data and information gathered using the standards of professional evaluation organizations. Both quantitative and qualitative methods can be rigorous and are usually required to answer evaluation questions. 4 Cost Effectiveness The expected benefits from a security cooperation evaluation should be a value greater than or equal to the resources expended on the evaluation. Cost effectiveness should also be weighed in determining how the evaluation will be used. b. Evaluations of other security cooperation activities may be commissioned by Department of Defense Components and other stakeholders to improve performance or answer key management questions. These evaluations should generally follow the standards identified within this section. c. Joint or collaborative evaluations are strongly encouraged when they 1 Facilitate mutual learning or reduce costs. 2 Are preceded by a memorandum of understanding that outlines costs expectations roles and responsibilities. d. Security cooperation evaluations will follow the internationally and U.S. Government recognized ethical standards in dealing with stakeholders and other informants including Department of DefenseI 5132.14 January 13 2017 SECTION 3. AME FRAMEWORK AND STANDARDS 17 1 Rights of Human Subjects Evaluations will comply with 32 Code of Federal Regulations Part 219 and Department of DefenseI 3216.02 to the extent those provisions apply. 2 Sensitivity Evaluators should be sensitive to the gender beliefs manners and customs of people as well as organizational structures and hierarchies as they conduct their research in culturally appropriate fashion. 3 Privacy and Confidentiality of Information The privacy and confidentiality of information should be maintained. If sensitive information is involved the identity of the informants must be protected in accordance with the Privacy Act and Department of Defense information policies as applicable. 4 Conflict of Interest Evaluators should strive to eliminate biases or vested interest in the evaluation outcomes. Evaluators or contracted firms should recuse themselves from an evaluation if they played any role in planning or supporting the execution of the program or could be perceived to benefit from the program being evaluated. e. Final evaluation reports should be clear and concise. The reports should be readable and as far as possible the language should be simple active familiar and culturally and politically sensitive. In accordance with U.S. Government best practices reports should 1 Include data findings conclusions and recommendations Such information can be collected by the evaluators or collected during monitoring. Findings represent the interpretation of data. Conclusions are the judgments that evaluators make about the initiative\u2019s performance outcomes and impacts based on findings. Recommendations for how future performance could be improved follow from the findings and conclusions. 2 Be organized around evaluation questions with findings conclusions and recommendations addressing each of the major questions. Reports should include these elements a Executive summary of evaluation. b Introduction and background. c Description of program or activity e.g. including budget beginning and end dates. d Purpose of evaluation. e Evaluation questions. f Description of the evaluation design including data collection methods used scope and methodology. g A statement about the time period of the evaluation work performance time spent in the field who did the work and the composition of the team. Department of DefenseI 5132.14 January 13 2017 SECTION 3. AME FRAMEWORK AND STANDARDS 18 h Strengths and limitations of the collected data. i Conclusions The overall conclusions synthesize findings from the questions asked and should be logical inferences based on findings of each question. j Recommendations Findings that require corrective action will need a recommendation directed at management officials who have the authority to act on it. Recommendations should state what needs to be corrected or achieved without being prescriptive. They should flow naturally from the findings and conclusions. k Appendices for additional documents including evaluation scope of workterms of reference. 3 Be accompanied by a briefing by the evaluators with key stakeholders to review results and debrief on evaluation process and procedures. f. To promote transparency of Department of Defense\u2019s security cooperation programs completed evaluations by the centralized evaluation office will include a separate summary for posting on Department of Defense\u2019s public website www.open.defense.gov unless the USDP in consultation with other Department of Defense Components determines that disclosure of the summary information could be expected to cause foreseeable harm to the United States or a partner nation. The summary of the evaluation should generally be no more than 24 pages and should include 1 The title of the evaluation and a brief overview of the programs or activities involved and relevant context. 2 The purpose of the evaluation and questions addressed. 3 The methodology used and its scope and limitation. 4 Key findings generally organized by evaluation questions. 5 Conclusions and if appropriate recommendations. g. Consistent with AME best practices and to promote accountability and the usefulness of evaluation results within 30 days of finalizing an evaluation report the relevant stakeholders should prepare a memorandum responding to the evaluation to the USDP indicating 1 Concurrence or nonconcurrence in evaluation recommendations e.g. do the relevant management officials agree with recommendations outlined in the report and if not why. 2 A plan for compliance with the recommendations e.g. how will management implement or act on recommendations from the report What changes will be made. 3 A timeframe for compliance e.g. when does management expect the recommendations to be implemented fully. Department of DefenseI 5132.14 January 13 2017 SECTION 3. AME FRAMEWORK AND STANDARDS 19 4 A point of contact for implementing recommendations e.g. who will be in charge of implementation.

AM&E FRAMEWORK AND STANDARDS  \n12 \nSECTION 3:  AM&E FRAMEWORK AND STANDARDS \n3.1  GENERAL FRAMEWORK. \na.  Department of Defense AM&E will be consistent with U.S. Government and international standards and \nbest practices.   \nb.  Department of Defense will maintain a hybrid approach to management of AM&E efforts, whereby, in \ngeneral, assessment and monitoring will be a decentralized effort based on the principles and \nguidelines established in this instruction and other directives, policies, and law; and evaluations \nat the strategic level will be centralized and overseen by the USD(P). \nc.  When possible, Department of Defense should align its AM&E efforts with those of host nation \ncounterparts, other donors, and implementing partners.  This should lessen the overall data-\ncollection burden and help promote security cooperation effectiveness. \nd.  Assessment, monitoring, and evaluation each serve a separate function at distinct points in \nthe security cooperation planning and implementation cycle (see Figure 1). \ne.  AM&E is required for all significant security cooperation initiatives.  Such initiatives are \ngenerally led by the geographic combatant commanders and are often articulated as specific lines of effort in the country-\nspecific security cooperation sections of a theater campaign plan.  Significant security \ncooperation initiatives involve the application of multiple security cooperation tools and \nprograms, which may be overseen and managed by various Department of Defense Components and the \nDepartment of State, over multiple years to realize a country- or region-specific objective or \nfunctional objective (e.g., maritime security or counterterrorism).  \nf.  Initiatives specifically designated as pilot programs (i.e., testing new concepts and \napproaches to security cooperation to assess their effectiveness and applicability to broader \nrequirements) should be appropriately planned, designed, monitored, and evaluated before being \nreplicated or expanded. \ng.  Accountability and learning are the primary purposes of AM&E and will shape efforts to \nleverage security cooperation more effectively in support of defense objectives in the near, \nmedium, and long terms.  AM&E indicates returns on investment, allows policymakers to \nidentify and improve or eliminate ineffective initiatives, and provides credible information in \nsupport of policy and legislation.  AM&E will help Department of Defense understand what security cooperation \nmethods work and why, and apply lessons learned and best practices to inform security \ncooperation resources and policy decisions. \n \n \nDepartment of DefenseI 5132.14, January 13, 2017 \nSECTION 3.  AM&E FRAMEWORK AND STANDARDS  \n13 \nFigure 1.  AM&E Framework \n \n3.2.  INITIAL ASSESSMENT STANDARDS.  Initial assessments are required before all \nsignificant security cooperation initiatives to inform IDDs, and are encouraged before all security \ncooperation activities.  The initial assessment provides an understanding of the context, \nconditions, partner capabilities, and requirements to inform security cooperation planning and \nimplementation.  Assessments identify potential risks to initiative success to help planners \ndevelop risk-mitigation strategies. \na.  Initial assessments describe host nation willingness and propensity to implement and \nsustain assistance, improve institutional capacity, and build capabilities in the context of country \nor other relevant objectives, and to identify requirements, gaps, and potential risks. \nb.  Analysis derived from an initial assessment should directly inform an IDD and related \ncountry plans in appropriate sections.  Initial assessments should include the following elements: \n(1)  The extent to which an allied or partner nation shares relevant strategic objectives \nwith the United States, as well as a partner\u2019s current ability to contribute to missions to address \nDepartment of DefenseI 5132.14, January 13, 2017 \nSECTION 3.  AM&E FRAMEWORK AND STANDARDS  \n14 \nsuch shared objectives, based on detailed holistic analysis of relevant partner capabilities such as \nthrough application of the doctrine, organizational structure, training, materiel, leadership and \neducation, personnel, facilities, and policy framework referenced in the Joint Capabilities \nIntegration and Development System, as established by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01I. \n(2)  Analysis of potential risks, including assumptions and possible consequences of \nimplementing and not implementing the initiative, program, or activity. \n(3)  Information to inform initiative design, including available contextual data, baselines, \nsuggested objectives, indicators and milestones, as well as recommendations on what can be \nachieved within a given timeframe with anticipated resources. \n(4)  Analysis of relevant environmental, economic, political, sociological, cultural, and \nother conditions that may directly impact the implementation of the initiative in a specific \ncountry.  \n(5)  The feasibility of achieving successful outcomes based on a partner\u2019s political \nwillingness to pursue the desired outcome; its absorptive capacity, including the extent to which \na partner can support, employ, and sustain assistance independently; its political stability; and its \nrespect for rule of law and human rights. \n(6)  Analysis of other related U.S. Government, non-governmental, and international \ngovernment organizations, and other stakeholder efforts that are underway or planned, including \nhow the security cooperation initiative may complement or compete with other programs or \nactivities. \n(7)  Other relevant information, assessments, completed evaluations and related \ndocuments that provide context for the initial assessment process. \n3.3.  SECURITY COOPERATION IDD STANDARDS.  An IDD is required of all significant \nsecurity cooperation initiatives.  The IDD should be developed through a deliberate and inclusive \nprocess, informed by the opportunities and risks identified in the initial assessment, to create a \ncomprehensive document.  In many cases, consulting the host nation can be helpful in the \ndevelopment of the IDD. \na.  The IDD should increase the likelihood that security cooperation investments are targeted, \nmeasurable, and effectively implemented.  To that end, it provides an overview of the activities \nand authorities to be applied in a synchronized manner to achieve the planned security \ncooperation outcome.  Specifically, IDDs should include: \n(1)  Clear linkage to goals or objectives in the theater campaign plan or other higher-level \nguidance. \n(2)  Problem statement, derived from the initial assessment, which is a clear description \nof the issue or challenge the initiative seeks to address.  Also known as the rationale, the problem \nstatement provides the basis and reasons for implementing a security cooperation initiative. \nDepartment of DefenseI 5132.14, January 13, 2017 \nSECTION 3.  AM&E FRAMEWORK AND STANDARDS  \n15 \n(3)  A comprehensive performance management section that includes: \n(a)  A logic framework for the initiative that maps goals and specific, measurable, \nachievable, relevant/results-oriented, and time-bound objectives to the activities necessary to \nachieve desired changes.  The logic framework visually describes activities and the planned \nprocess of contributing to initiative goals and achieving objectives. \n(b)  Indicators and milestones, ideally with baselines and targets, tied to the specific, \nmeasureable, achievable, relevant/results-oriented, and time-bound objectives that quantitatively \nor qualitatively measure the outputs and outcomes of the security cooperation initiative toward \nachieving stated objectives. \n(c)  A theory of change, intended to make implicit assumptions more explicit, which \ndescribes why certain actions will produce a desired change in a given context, and clearly states \nwhat the intended outcome of the initiative will be and how it will be achieved. \n(4)  Guidance to relevant stakeholders on how their security cooperation tools and \nactivities should contribute to the security cooperation initiative and expectations regarding their \nrole in supporting AM&E efforts.  It should also include data-collection details, parameters, \nfrequency, and responsibility; how results will be used and communicated; and recommendations \non when to evaluate the program. \nb.  IDDs should be updated as circumstances change, maintained and retained by the relevant \nDepartment of Defense Component, and shared among initiative and AM&E stakeholders. \n3.4.  PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING STANDARDS.  \nPerformance monitoring for security cooperation will vary depending on the initiative or activity.  \nParameters and expectations for monitoring of indicators or milestones at pre-determined \nintervals throughout implementation should be clearly outlined in the performance management \nsection of the IDD. \na.  Monitoring may be focused at different levels, such as: \n(1)  Output monitoring at the implementation level of specific deliverables such as goods \nand services to document progress during initiative implementation (e.g., number of training \nevents delivered).  Output monitoring may be particularly useful to program managers and \nimplementers. \n(2)  Outcome monitoring at the leadership or management level of the results of security \ncooperation initiatives (e.g., was capacity built based on our training?  Did the partner nation \nsuccessfully employ the Department of Defense-provided system in support of the intended mission?).  Outcome \nmonitoring may be particularly useful to geographic combatant commanders and organizations with policy, oversight, and \nmanagement responsibilities.   \nb.  Department of Defense will rely on existing data collection processes managed by Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the geographic combatant commanders, and \nother Department of Defense Components for all security cooperation activities.  Data collected for each indicator \nshould be organized in a systematic way to facilitate analysis and tracking trends to support \nDepartment of DefenseI 5132.14, January 13, 2017 \nSECTION 3.  AM&E FRAMEWORK AND STANDARDS  \n16 \nprogram-management decisions.  Although data should be reported at planned intervals, it may \nbe modified to reflect the situation on the ground. \nc.  Monitoring, which also may include site visits, should also review and identify any \nchanges in the operational and strategic environment since the initial assessment and identify any \nunforeseen challenges that impact initiative execution and implementation. \n3.5.  EVALUATION STANDARDS. \na.  The USD(P) will maintain an office responsible for leading a centralized effort for \nindependent evaluations to measure the effectiveness and impact of significant security \ncooperation initiatives toward meeting expected outcomes.  Evaluations will be primarily \nconducted at the strategic level using the appropriate methodology based on context, available \nresources, and data.  Standards for evaluations will be based on the American Evaluation \nAssociation and the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development.  The four principles in Paragraphs 3.5.a. (1) through (4) should \nbe incorporated into all evaluations conducted by Department of Defense. \n(1)  Usefulness:  The information, ideas, and recommendations generated by evaluations \nshould serve a need or answer specific strategic questions for Department of Defense. \n(2)  Independence:  Evaluators should be able to gather and analyze data and information \nfreely and follow rigorous and scientifically valid methodologies.  All evaluations should be free \nfrom any interference from the commissioning unit or management. \n(3)  Methodological and Analytical Rigor:  Evaluations should be evidence-based, relying \non verifiable data and information gathered using the standards of professional evaluation \norganizations.  Both quantitative and qualitative methods can be rigorous and are usually \nrequired to answer evaluation questions. \n(4)  Cost Effectiveness:  The expected benefits from a security cooperation evaluation \nshould be a value greater than, or equal to, the resources expended on the evaluation.  Cost \neffectiveness should also be weighed in determining how the evaluation will be used. \nb.  Evaluations of other security cooperation activities may be commissioned by Department of Defense \nComponents and other stakeholders to improve performance or answer key management \nquestions.  These evaluations should generally follow the standards identified within this section. \nc.  Joint or collaborative evaluations are strongly encouraged when they: \n(1)  Facilitate mutual learning or reduce costs. \n(2)  Are preceded by a memorandum of understanding that outlines costs, expectations, \nroles, and responsibilities. \nd.  Security cooperation evaluations will follow the internationally and U.S. Government-\nrecognized ethical standards in dealing with stakeholders and other informants, including: \nDepartment of DefenseI 5132.14, January 13, 2017 \nSECTION 3.  AM&E FRAMEWORK AND STANDARDS  \n17 \n(1)  Rights of Human Subjects:  Evaluations will comply with 32 Code of Federal Regulations Part 219 and Department of DefenseI \n3216.02 to the extent those provisions apply. \n(2)  Sensitivity:  Evaluators should be sensitive to the gender, beliefs, manners, and \ncustoms of people as well as organizational structures and hierarchies as they conduct their \nresearch in culturally appropriate fashion. \n(3)  Privacy and Confidentiality of Information:  The privacy and confidentiality of \ninformation should be maintained.  If sensitive information is involved, the identity of the \ninformants must be protected in accordance with the Privacy Act and Department of Defense information policies \nas applicable. \n(4)  Conflict of Interest:  Evaluators should strive to eliminate biases or vested interest in \nthe evaluation outcomes.  Evaluators or contracted firms should recuse themselves from an \nevaluation if they played any role in planning or supporting the execution of the program or \ncould be perceived to benefit from the program being evaluated. \ne.  Final evaluation reports should be clear and concise.  The reports should be readable and, \nas far as possible, the language should be simple, active, familiar, and culturally and politically \nsensitive.  In accordance with U.S. Government best practices, reports should: \n(1)  Include data, findings, conclusions, and recommendations:  Such information can be \ncollected by the evaluators or collected during monitoring.  Findings represent the interpretation \nof data.  Conclusions are the judgments that evaluators make about the initiative\u2019s performance, \noutcomes, and impacts based on findings.  Recommendations for how future performance could \nbe improved follow from the findings and conclusions. \n(2)  Be organized around evaluation questions, with findings, conclusions, and \nrecommendations addressing each of the major questions.  Reports should include these \nelements:  \n(a)  Executive summary of evaluation. \n(b)  Introduction and background. \n(c)  Description of program or activity (e.g., including budget, beginning and end \ndates). \n(d)  Purpose of evaluation. \n(e)  Evaluation questions. \n(f)  Description of the evaluation design, including data collection methods used, \nscope, and methodology. \n(g)  A statement about the time period of the evaluation work performance, time spent \nin the field, who did the work, and the composition of the team. \nDepartment of DefenseI 5132.14, January 13, 2017 \nSECTION 3.  AM&E FRAMEWORK AND STANDARDS  \n18 \n(h)  Strengths and limitations of the collected data. \n(i)  Conclusions:  The overall conclusions synthesize findings from the questions \nasked and should be logical inferences based on findings of each question. \n(j)  Recommendations:  Findings that require corrective action will need a \nrecommendation directed at management officials who have the authority to act on it.  \nRecommendations should state what needs to be corrected or achieved without being \nprescriptive.  They should flow naturally from the findings and conclusions. \n(k)  Appendices for additional documents, including evaluation scope of work/terms \nof reference. \n(3)  Be accompanied by a briefing by the evaluators with key stakeholders to review \nresults and debrief on evaluation process and procedures. \nf.  To promote transparency of Department of Defense\u2019s security cooperation programs, completed evaluations \nby the centralized evaluation office will include a separate summary for posting on Department of Defense\u2019s public \nwebsite (www.open.defense.gov) unless the USD(P), in consultation with other Department of Defense \nComponents, determines that disclosure of the summary information could be expected to cause \nforeseeable harm to the United States or a partner nation.  The summary of the evaluation should \ngenerally be no more than 2-4 pages and should include: \n(1)  The title of the evaluation and a brief overview of the programs or activities involved \nand relevant context. \n(2)  The purpose of the evaluation and questions addressed. \n(3)  The methodology used and its scope and limitation. \n(4)  Key findings generally organized by evaluation questions. \n(5)  Conclusions and, if appropriate, recommendations. \ng.  Consistent with AM&E best practices and to promote accountability and the usefulness of \nevaluation results, within 30 days of finalizing an evaluation report the relevant stakeholders \nshould prepare a memorandum responding to the evaluation to the USD(P), indicating: \n(1)  Concurrence or non-concurrence in evaluation recommendations (e.g., do the \nrelevant management officials agree with recommendations outlined in the report and, if not, \nwhy?). \n(2)  A plan for compliance with the recommendations (e.g., how will management \nimplement or act on recommendations from the report? What changes will be made?). \n(3)  A timeframe for compliance (e.g., when does management expect the \nrecommendations to be implemented fully?). \nDepartment of DefenseI 5132.14, January 13, 2017 \nSECTION 3.

Obligation to demonstrate, deliver on, and report on what has been achieved in \ncompliance with agreed rules, policies, and standards. \nassessment.  Systematic analysis to provide an understanding of the context, conditions, partner \ncapabilities, and requirements to inform security cooperation planning and implementation.  \nAssessments are generally conducted in advance of security cooperation activities, but may be \nrepeated to update analysis and identify mid-course corrections of security cooperation activities.   \ncountry-specific security cooperation section.  A section of the theater campaign plan in which \nthe geographic combatant commanders articulate their intent to apply time, money, and effort through security cooperation \nprograms in a specific country to further U.S. defense objectives or set the theater for a potential \ncontingency in their campaign plan.  Country-specific security cooperation sections serve as the \ncore organizing documents for articulating Department of Defense country-level objectives for the application of \nsecurity cooperation at the country level, and inform and are informed by corresponding \nintegrated country strategies.  Each country-specific security cooperation section identifies \nspecific lines of effort that: \nRepresent the significant security cooperation initiatives planned for the country. \nArticulate specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound objectives in support of \nsuch initiatives.   \neffectiveness.  The extent to which a security cooperation initiative has attained its objectives or \nintended results. \nDepartment of DefenseI 5132.14, January 13, 2017 \nGLOSSARY  \n21 \nefficiency.  A measure of how economically resources (e.g., funds, expertise, time) are used to \nachieve results. \nevaluation.  A systematic collection and analysis of information and evidence about the \ncharacteristics and outcomes of an ongoing or completed initiative, and its design, \nimplementation, and results.  Evaluations determine relevance, value, effectiveness, efficiency, \nsustainability, and impact as a basis for improving effectiveness and to inform decision makers \nregarding future plans, programs, and activities.  Evaluation, distinct from assessment and \nmonitoring, focuses on documenting the achievement of outcomes and results and in some cases \nthe value of continuing the investment. \nevaluation recommendations.  Proposals based on evaluation findings and conclusions that are \naimed at enhancing the effectiveness, efficiency, quality, or processes of a security cooperation \nprogram or activity.  \nindicator.  Quantitative or qualitative factor or variable that provides a simple and reliable \nmeans to measure achievement, to reflect the anticipated changes connected to an intervention, \nor to help assess the performance of a security cooperation actor.  Two types of indicators are \nrelevant for security cooperation AM&E efforts: \nOutput - good or service delivered. \nOutcome - condition achieved as a result of outputs. \ninitial assessment.  Information collected before or at the start of an initiative that provides a \nbasis for planning, monitoring, or evaluating subsequent progress or impact. \nIDD.  A comprehensive document that specifies the specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, \nand time-bound objectives, theory of change, and performance management plan for a security \ncooperation initiative.  \njoint evaluations.  Joint or collaborative evaluations are evaluations undertaken by two or more \nstakeholders involved in a security cooperation initiative, either within Department of Defense or between Department of Defense and \nother U.S. Government departments, agencies, or other stakeholders, including the host nation.   \nmilestone.  A scheduled event that indicates the completion of a major task of a program. \nMilestones are observable and enable the measurement of the progress of a program. \nmonitoring.  A continuous process designed to provide regular feedback on the extent to which \nexpected outputs and outcomes are being achieved to inform decisions or corrective actions.  In \ngeneral, results measured in monitoring are the direct and near-term consequences of initiative \nactivities that provide opportunities to validate the theory of change throughout implementation \nand an early indication of the likelihood that expected results will be attained. \nobjective.  A statement of a desired result that meets the criteria of being specific, measurable, \nattainable, relevant, and time-bound. \nDepartment of DefenseI 5132.14, January 13, 2017 \nGLOSSARY  \n22 \noutput.  The direct, tangible results of initiatives.  A deliverable or product, good, or service \ndirectly resulting from a security cooperation initiative or activity, such as the number of training \nevents and the number of unit members trained.  These early work products often serve as \ndocumentation of progress during implementation and monitoring. \noutcome.  The results achieved by initiatives.  Some outcomes of interest for security \ncooperation are whether partner capability is being built to meet standards, to what extent, and \nwhether it is achieved within a desired time frame.  Three types of outcomes include:  \nShort-term.  Immediate effects of the initiative or activities often focused on the knowledge \nand attitudes of the intended audience. \nIntermediate.  Intermediate effects on behavior or normative or policy changes. \nLong-term (also impact).  Long-term, cumulative effects of interventions over time on what \nthey ultimately aim to change (e.g., capabilities, security conditions).   \nperformance management plan.  A specific plan to manage the process of monitoring, \nevaluating, and analyzing progress toward achieving results over the life of a program.  \npilot program.  An innovative program conducted on a small scale to examine its model, \nimplementation, effects, and outcomes to determine whether it should be replicated on a larger \nscale or expanded in a different environment. \nsecurity cooperation offices.  Department of Defense organizations permanently located in foreign countries and \nassigned responsibilities for carrying out security cooperation management functions in \naccordance with Section 515 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended.  Security \ncooperation offices may include military assistance advisory groups, military missions and \ngroups, and Offices of Defense and Military Cooperation designated to perform security \ncooperation functions.  They do not include units, formations, or other ad hoc organizations that \nconduct security cooperation activities, such as mobile training and education teams or \noperational units. \nsecurity cooperation.  All Department of Defense interactions with foreign defense establishments to build \nrelationships that promote specific U.S. security interests, develop allied and partner nation \nmilitary and security capabilities for self-defense and multinational operations, and provide U.S. \nforces with peacetime and contingency access to allied and partner nations.  This also includes \nDepartment of Defense-administered security assistance programs. \nsecurity cooperation funding.  Allocated funds, including both base and overseas contingency \noperations appropriations, to any program or activity that is intended primarily for the purpose of \nsecurity cooperation.  This category includes programs and activities used to train and equip \npartners; provide technical, educational, financial, or humanitarian assistance; conduct military-\nto-military or defense civilian contacts, engagements, or exchanges; provide support to \noperations conducted by partner nations; and conduct other relevant bilateral and multilateral \nactivities. \nDepartment of DefenseI 5132.14, January 13, 2017 \nGLOSSARY  \n23 \nSecurity cooperation funding does not include programs or activities with a primary purpose \nother than security cooperation, even where there are secondary security cooperation benefits, \nsuch as combined exercises or combined training primarily intended to improve U.S. military \nreadiness.  Covered funding is limited to those funds used for incremental execution costs and \nprogram management costs, and do not include costs associated with manning, training, and \nequipping force elements used to implement such activities. \nsignificant security cooperation initiative.  The series of activities, projects, and programs \nplanned as a unified, multi-year effort to achieve a single desired outcome or set of related \noutcomes.  Such initiatives are generally planned by the geographic Combatant Commands and \ninvolve the application of multiple security cooperation tools over multiple years to realize a \ncountry- or region-specific objective or functional objective as articulated in the country-specific \nsecurity cooperation sections of a theater campaign plan. \nsustainability.

Evaluations will be primarily conducted at the strategic level using the appropriate methodology based on context available resources and data. Standards for evaluations will be based on the American Evaluation Association and the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The four principles in Paragraphs 3.5.a. 1 through 4 should be incorporated into all evaluations conducted by DoD. 1 Usefulness The information ideas and recommendations generated by evaluations should serve a need or answer specific strategic questions for DoD. 2 Independence Evaluators should be able to gather and analyze data and information freely and follow rigorous and scientifically valid methodologies. All evaluations should be free from any interference from the commissioning unit or management. 3 Methodological and Analytical Rigor Evaluations should be evidencebased relying on verifiable data and information gathered using the standards of professional evaluation organizations. Both quantitative and qualitative methods can be rigorous and are usually required to answer evaluation questions. 4 Cost Effectiveness The expected benefits from a security cooperation evaluation should be a value greater than or equal to the resources expended on the evaluation. Cost effectiveness should also be weighed in determining how the evaluation will be used. b. Evaluations of other security cooperation activities may be commissioned by DoD Components and other stakeholders to improve performance or answer key management questions. These evaluations should generally follow the standards identified within this section. c. Joint or collaborative evaluations are strongly encouraged when they 1 Facilitate mutual learning or reduce costs. 2 Are preceded by a memorandum of understanding that outlines costs expectations roles and responsibilities. d.

The USD(P) will maintain an office responsible for leading a centralized effort for \nindependent evaluations to measure the effectiveness and impact of significant security \ncooperation initiatives toward meeting expected outcomes.  Evaluations will be primarily \nconducted at the strategic level using the appropriate methodology based on context, available \nresources, and data.  Standards for evaluations will be based on the American Evaluation \nAssociation and the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development.  The four principles in Paragraphs 3.5.a. (1) through (4) should \nbe incorporated into all evaluations conducted by DoD. \n(1)  Usefulness:  The information, ideas, and recommendations generated by evaluations \nshould serve a need or answer specific strategic questions for DoD. \n(2)  Independence:  Evaluators should be able to gather and analyze data and information \nfreely and follow rigorous and scientifically valid methodologies.  All evaluations should be free \nfrom any interference from the commissioning unit or management. \n(3)  Methodological and Analytical Rigor:  Evaluations should be evidence-based, relying \non verifiable data and information gathered using the standards of professional evaluation \norganizations.  Both quantitative and qualitative methods can be rigorous and are usually \nrequired to answer evaluation questions. \n(4)  Cost Effectiveness:  The expected benefits from a security cooperation evaluation \nshould be a value greater than, or equal to, the resources expended on the evaluation.  Cost \neffectiveness should also be weighed in determining how the evaluation will be used. \nb.  Evaluations of other security cooperation activities may be commissioned by DoD \nComponents and other stakeholders to improve performance or answer key management \nquestions.  These evaluations should generally follow the standards identified within this section. \nc.  Joint or collaborative evaluations are strongly encouraged when they: \n(1)  Facilitate mutual learning or reduce costs. \n(2)  Are preceded by a memorandum of understanding that outlines costs, expectations, \nroles, and responsibilities. \nd.  Security cooperation evaluations will follow the internationally and U.S. Government-\nrecognized ethical standards in dealing with stakeholders and other informants, including: \n"}, {"type": "page", "id": "DoDI 5132.14.pdf_16", "filename": "DoDI 5132.14.pdf", "p_page": 16, "p_text": "DoDI 5132.14 January 13 2017 SECTION 3.
