# Contribution Policy

borrowed from https://github.com/Code-dot-mil/code.mil/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

### 1. Introduction

The project maintainer for this Project will only accept contributions using the Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 located at [developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org) ("DCO"). The DCO is a legally binding statement asserting that you are the creator of your contribution, or that you otherwise have the authority to distribute the contribution, and that you are intentionally making the contribution available under the license associated with the Project ("License").

### 2. Developer Certificate of Origin Process

Before submitting contributing code to this repository for the first time, you'll need to sign a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) (see below). To agree to the DCO, add your name and email address to the [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) file. At a high level, adding your information to this file tells us that you have the right to submit the work you're contributing and indicates that you consent to our treating the contribution in a way consistent with the license associated with this software (as described in [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md)) and its documentation ("Project").

### 3. Important Points

Pseudonymous or anonymous contributions are permissible, but you must be reachable at the email address provided in the Signed-off-by line.

If your contribution is significant, you are also welcome to add your name and copyright date to the source file header.

U.S. Federal law prevents the government from accepting gratuitous services unless certain conditions are met. By submitting a pull request, you acknowledge that your services are offered without expectation of payment and that you expressly waive any future pay claims against the U.S. Federal government related to your contribution.

If you are a U.S. Federal government employee and use a `*.mil` or `*.gov` email address, we interpret your Signed-off-by to mean that the contribution was created in whole or in part by you and that your contribution is not subject to copyright protections.

### 4. DCO Text
