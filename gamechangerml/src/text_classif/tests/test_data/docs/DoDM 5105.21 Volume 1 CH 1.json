The goal of information sharing is to provide appropriately cleared customers i.e. those with the necessary clearance access approval and need to know with all the intelligence information they need to fulfill their missions. d. The procedures set forth in this Volume are the standards for protecting SCI. The DoD Components shall not establish or disseminate operational or administrative procedures inconsistent with the security standards prescribed herein. HICE may impose more stringent procedures if they believe extraordinary conditions and circumstances warrant. e. In emergencies or when there is a danger of compromise the DoD Components and DoD contractors are authorized to communicate directly with the DAC concerning SCI policy matters. All other matters should be resolved through the established chain of command. f. During hostilities wartime or exercise conditions the authority and reporting channels for SCI security cognizance shall run parallel to the theater command and operational lines of authority. This procedure exists because staff oversight of SCI security is the direct responsibility of the SIO responsible for the theater. The SSO of the Combatant Command has SCI security cognizance for units deployed in the Combatant Command\u2019s theater of operations. g. Service Cryptologic Components those Military Service elements that are assigned to the CSS are under the direction and management of the Director NSAChief CSS for physical DoDM 5105.21V1 October 19 2012 Change 1 05162018 ENCLOSURE 3 18 TEMPEST and IS security matters. Any SCI policy conflict shall be resolved by negotiation between the Military Department and NSA. 2. RISK MANAGEMENT a. SCI security officials shall employ the principles of risk management and riskbased analysis when developing and implementing protective measures. Riskbased analysis should provide for increased efficiency of operations and coutilization of facilities wherever practical. SCI security officials shall request waivers to SCI security policy from their respective CSAs and justify the need for deviation from established security methods. b. SCI security officials shall obtain a threat assessment of the current criminal espionage sabotage subversion and terrorist threat situation from their supporting law enforcement agency and counterintelligence support office or equivalent. Security countermeasures to meet these threats shall be tailored based on risk management. 3. DIRECT REPORTINGCOMMUNICATIONS AUTHORIZED. Each DoD Component shall establish procedures for SCI security officials to communicate directly with the appropriate HICE or designee on emergency matters that affect plans or operations when there is a danger of compromise and the established chain of command cannot be followed. SCI security officials under the cognizance of the SSO DIA security authority may communicate directly with the SSO DAC on emergency matters where SCI is in imminent danger of compromise. At all other times SCI security officials shall follow their chain of command for the processing of SCIrelated matters. Contractors shall go through the contracting officer to the organization that issued the contract. 4. PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION a. SCI shall not be published released to or discussed with unauthorized persons or the public media. HICEs shall not authorize declassification of SCI for public release without the prior written approval of the appropriate DNI security executive agent. Requests for such declassification action shall be forwarded through command SCI security channels to the appropriate DNI executive agent. Requests for news media information shall be forwarded through the appropriate command SCI security channels to the appropriate HICE or designee. b. Unauthorized disclosure of SCI disclosure that has not been approved for release by the HICE or appropriate DNI security executive agent in public media does not alter the basic security policies and procedures contained in this Manual or the information\u2019s original classification. Such information remains classified. Individuals are not relieved of their obligation to maintain the secrecy of such information and are bound by the provisions of SF 312 Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement and DD Form 18471 Sensitive Compartmented Information Nondisclosure Statement. No additional facts amplification or comments shall be made about unauthorized disclosures of classified information. DoDM 5105.21V1 October 19 2012 Change 1 05162018 ENCLOSURE 3 19 5. FOREIGN DISCLOSURE. The provisions of this section shall not be waived. a. All classified intelligence information intended for release outside the originating agency shall be explicitly marked with at least one of the authorized mandatory foreign release markings Releasable by Intelligence Disclosure Official RELIDO Releasable to REL TO or Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals NOFORN or FOR DISPLAY ONLY to assist customers in information sharing. b. SCI may be disclosed or released to foreign governments and international organizations in one of two ways 1 As SCI in accordance with DCID 67 Reference p pursuant to a DNIapproved bilateral or multilateral agreement or arrangement or 2 As sanitized or otherwise altered SCIderived information at the collateral level after approval by a duly authorized foreign disclosure officer in accordance with National Disclosure Policy Reference q. c. Reference p provides Intelligence Community policy and procedures for the disclosure and release of SCI and classified intelligence to foreign governments and international organizations and coalition partners consisting of sovereign states. 1 Disclosure or release of SCI beyond existing DNI policy guidance must be coordinated with the originator of the information and the Assistant DNI for Policy and Strategy. 2 Any release of SCI to foreign governments must be approved by the SCI originator. 3 SCI shall not be disclosed to other foreign entities without approval from the DNI his designee or the HICE as appropriate. 4 Release of SCIrelated unclassified technology is subject to export controls as established by the DoD Department of State and Department of Commerce. 6. PROTECTION OF SOURCES AND METHODS a. DCID 66 Reference r establishes policy for the use of dissemination controls to maximize the dissemination of intelligence consistent with national security requirements and the need to protect sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure. Although dissemination controls are important tools in carrying out the DNI\u2019s statutory responsibilities to protect sources and methods inappropriate use of such controls impedes efficient and timely access to intelligence information required to meet customer needs. Therefore all IC organizations will apply dissemination controls judiciously to ensure the intelligence information is disseminated to those who need it without unnecessary restrictions. DoDM 5105.21V1 October 19 2012 Change 1 05162018 ENCLOSURE 3 20 b. Access to SCI is based on ICD 704 Reference s eligibility needtoknow formal access approval and indoctrination. SCI will be disseminated at the lowest level of classification that will satisfy official requirements. c. All DoD Components will ensure that the intelligence they produce and disseminate excludes sanitizes or generalizes in descending order of preference the source and method data. Producers of finished intelligence shall 1 Avoid publishing products that must be controlled in collection system compartments. When treatment of a particular subject in an intelligence product requires discussion of operationally compartmented sources and methods a special supplement appropriately controlled in compartmented channels is the preferred approach. 2 Ensure unavoidable references to intelligence sources or methods are as nonspecific as practicable. Subject to the provisions of collection system manuals generalized discussion of compartmented collection capabilities is permitted in finished intelligence products controlled in a productoriented compartment. Discussion of collection gaps capabilities to provide indications and warning intelligence or advice on the reliability of sources in finished intelligence at a relatively low level of compartmentalization must not exceed allowable boundaries of SCI control and thereby risk exposure of particularly sensitive intelligence. d. The policy constraint on the use of compartmented information regarding sources and methods in finished intelligence products applies to all DoD publications including formal and informal memorandums and studies. 7. STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE SOPs. SCI security officials shall establish written SOPs as required for their individual operational environments. The SSO shall ensure that SOPs do not conflict with DNI DoD or Military Department regulatory guidance. The SSO for the facility to which the SOP applies and the contractor management official responsible for SCI shall review SOPs and forward to the SIO Commander delegated Component official or corporate official for approval. The approving official shall thereafter review them annually and document the review in writing. SOPs shall be part of the security orientation for personnel assigned to the areas to which the SOPs apply. 8. POLICY WAIVERS a. Except as otherwise stated the HICEs may waive the provisions of this Manual under extraordinary circumstances. The HICE may delegate this authority to the CSA. Waivers will be issued for a specific period usually 1 year or as otherwise specified by the waiver. The requester must correct the situation covered by the waiver prior to the expiration date or request an extension of the waiver. The local SCI security official shall inform other agencies or services desiring to share the facility of the waiver condition. Exceptions to policy shall be kept on file in the SSO and in the field unit SCIF as applicable. DoDM 5105.21V1 October 19 2012 Change 1 05162018 ENCLOSURE 3 21 b. Waivers for the physical or technical security of a SCIF shall be done in accordance with the procedures outlined in ICD 705 Reference t and Volume 2 of this Manual. c. This Manual does NOT authorize the waiver of reporting requirements to law enforcement or counterintelligence agencies. 9. INSPECTIONS. DIADAC is the authority for DoD SCIF inspections. DAC is authorized to inspect periodically any DoD SCIF and direct action to correct any deficiency including removal of SCIF accreditation. A physical inspection shall be conducted prior to accreditation by DAC or its designee as part of the accreditation process. After accreditation inspections will be conducted periodically and will be based on risk management principles. Inspections shall be conducted in accordance with Reference t this Manual and any other applicable DoD issuances. At a minimum the inspection will include SCI security policy and procedures security administration information security personnel security physical security technical security and IA. a. Periodic inspections will be scheduled based on threat sensitivity physical modifications and past security performance. Inspections may occur at any time announced or unannounced. Additional inspections may be conducted in the event of suspected compromise or incidents history of deficiencies major facility modification or change in threat level. b. Authorized inspectors See Glossary for definition will be admitted to a SCIF without delay or hindrance. Governmentowned inspection equipment will be admitted into a SCIF without delay. c. Inspectors will submit a written report following each inspection identifying any deficiencies and corrective action to be taken. The report will be forwarded to appropriate SCI officials and a copy maintained within the inspected SCIF and by DAC. Joint users of the SCIF will accept the results of DIA security reviews for validation of security compliance. These written reports will be available to the DNI or designee upon request. d. Staff assistance visits SAVs must be conducted to review security support actions and administrative inquiries and to support program review and approval as deemed appropriate by the CSA. Any recommendations that affect physical security TEMPEST or technical security will be validated by DAC prior to corrective action or expenditure of funds. When a report is issued by an SCI security official findings and corrective actions are subject to review during the next inspection. e. SCI security officials shall conduct selfinspections of their SCIFs annually and will use the selfinspection checklist provided on the DIADAC Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication SystemJWICS webpage at httpwww.dia.ic.govhomepagedasecurityfieldscifforms.html. The purpose of the self inspection is to ensure compliance with the policies and procedures contained in this Manual and other applicable SCI security regulations and directives. Selfinspections will be coordinated with the site IA manager IAM and will include the areas of SCI security policy and procedures DoDM 5105.21V1 October 19 2012 Change 1 05162018 ENCLOSURE 3 22 security administration information security personnel security physical security technical security TEMPEST and TSCM and IA. SCI security officials will use the selfinspection checklist provided on the DIA DAC webpage at httpwww.dia.smil.milhomepagedasecurityfield. Results of the inspections will be routed through the unit commanderCOR to the Component SSO. SCI security officials must specify in writing all findings and corrective actions taken and retain the report until the next self inspection. An annual summary of selfinspection findings and actions will be forwarded to DIADAC2 by the Military Department CSAs and Component SIOs. f. Only SCIindoctrinated personnel knowledgeable of SCI policies may perform inspections of physical security information security personnel security TEMPEST security violations security education visitor control procedures and other requirements outlined in this Manual. Inspections by nonSCI indoctrinated entities is limited to the mission of the SCIF collateral security matters antiterrorismforce protection counterintelligence Operations Security automated information security and those nonSCI command issues such as safety fire marshals supply accountability crime prevention readiness etc. Such entities may also review the facility\u2019s most recent selfinspection checklist to ensure that the selfinspection was conducted and make note of any discrepancies. Only DIA can direct corrective action when an item affects the physical or TEMPEST accreditation of the SCIF. 10. DIA COMPARTMENTED ADDRESS BOOK CAB a. A CAB record contains the name of the organization its major command SCIF collateral mailing address DCD address DSSCS and GENSER plain language message addresses contact information for the SCIF primary and alternate managers and the security classification and compartments the SCIF is authorized to receive and maintain. CAB records also contain an area for the SSO to list all elements they support. The CAB record contains a large free text area for special instructions such as how to pass clearances to the SSO and another free text area for recording JPAS designations. b. SSOs shall submit changes to the CAB as they occur to their HICE or Component SIO via message or email. c. The HICEs are authorized to appoint individuals in their immediate organization to directly make these validated changes to the CAB. Designations must be made via message to SSO DIAEON2A with the subject line CAB Validator Appointment. 11. IA. DIA Directive 8500.002 Reference u and ICD 503 Reference v contain the policy and procedures pertaining to automated IS security for SCI. The IA program was established to maintain the security of intelligence IS and data stored transmitted and processed on these systems. IA officials will coordinate with the SSO on matters concerning ISnetwork security as needed to provide full compliance with all applicable security directives. DoDM 5105.21V1 October 19 2012 Change 1 05162018 ENCLOSURE 4 23 ENCLOSURE 4 IS 1. ORIGINATOR AND CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITIES a. Originators. The drafter of a document or other classified material is responsible for properly complying with established security classification guidance and for properly applying that guidance to the material including all markings required for its protection control and dissemination. Each individual is also responsible for ensuring SCI material is properly protected. All personnel who produce transmit reproduce or extract SCI from documents or other materials must properly mark and protect the resulting SCI product. They shall protect all hard copies soft copies and other related media including but not limited to computer disks and typewriter ribbons in the same manner as the final material and shall report errors in classification and marking control or dissemination problems to the responsible SCI security official. In addition they shall 1 Include SCI in documents or products only when necessary to accomplish an essential official purpose and produce as few copies as necessary. 2 In developing SCI material give primary consideration to the intended use of the information and organize the document if possible so that SCI can be disseminated separately on a more limited basis such as in an annex or supplement. Review the document before final production to ensure only the minimum scope and level of information essential to the task is included. 3 Produce SCI in a manner that will promote at all times positive control safeguarding and needtoknow access only. b. Contractors. Contractors will ensure SCI information in their custody is used or retained only in furtherance of a lawful and authorized U.S. Government purpose. Contractors are required to return all SCI material to the COR COTR or Government program manager when their contract expires or closes out unless the U.S. Government has given the contractor permission to retain the classified material in accordance with Chapter 5 of DoD 5220.22M Reference w. This requirement must be included in item 13 or 14 of the DD Form 254. The information management system employed by the contractor shall be capable of facilitating such retrieval and disposition in an expeditious manner. 2. STANDARD CLASSIFICATION MARKINGS. Classification and control markings shall be applied explicitly and uniformly when creating disseminating and using classified and unclassified information to maximize information sharing while protecting sources methods and activities from unauthorized or unintentional disclosure. Documents containing SCI shall be marked in accordance with ICD 710 Reference x. Standard classification markings are markings that indicate the level of classification the source of classification and for original DoDM 5105.21V1 October 19 2012 Change 1 05162018 ENCLOSURE 4 24 classification decisions the reason for classification the agency and office of origin and downgrading and declassification instructions. Also included are warnings notices if applicable intelligence control markings portion markings and page markings. a. Levels of Classification. There are three levels of classification TOP SECRET SECRET and CONFIDENTIAL. b. Authority for Classification. The classification authority designates the basis for classification and is either an original or derivative. 1 Original Classification Authority OCA. OCA is the initial determination that information could be expected to cause damage to national security if subjected to unauthorized disclosure. This decision shall be made only by OCAs who have been specifically delegated the authority to do so have received training in the exercise of this authority and have program responsibility or cognizance over the information. OCAs shall develop classification guides for subject matter under his or her cognizance. Original classification decisions made by an OCA should be recorded in a security classification guide. a Reasons for Classifying. To be eligible for classification information must fall within one or more of the categories of information listed in section 1.4. of Reference l. The Reason line is only used on documents originally classified by an OCA. b Duration of Classification. At the time of original classification the OCA shall establish a specific date or event for declassification based upon the sensitivity of the national security information. Upon reaching the date or event the information will automatically be declassified. 2 Derivative Classification a The marking of the newly developed information is consistent with the classification markings that apply to the originally classified source. This includes the classification of the information based on a security classification guide or source documents. The majority of classified information is produced by derivative classification. The derivative classifier shall maintain the identification of each source with the file or record copy of the derivatively classified document. The derivative classifier shall include the source list in or with all copies of the derivatively classified document. b When preparing a new document from several classified documents the marking will reflect the highest classification of information extracted from the various source documents. 3. MARKING DOCUMENTS. All classified information shall be clearly marked so as to leave no doubt as to the classification level the reason for classification the duration of classification and the authority or source for classification. Proper markings are required for both hard copy and electronic classified documents. Guidance for the IC and DoD marking requirements and DoDM 5105.21V1 October 19 2012 Change 1 05162018 ENCLOSURE 4 25 the categories of classification and control markings can be found in Reference k and the DNI CAPCO Authorized Classification and Control Markings Register Reference y. 4. RESTRICTED DECLASSIFICATION VALUES AND CAVEATS a. MANUAL REVIEW MR. The use of MR as a declassification value is no longer authorized as specification of declassification values has been eliminated from the classification banner lines of national intelligence documents. The full textual description of the event date for declassification or authorized exemption must be specified in the ClassificationDeclassification block on the first page of the classified document as required by paragraph 3.c of this enclosure. b. NOFORN 1 The NOFORN caveat will only be applied to intelligence information in accordance with References p and r. Only HICEs or OCAs in elements of the IC may determine what information warrants application of the NOFORN caveat. Derivative classifiers shall only use the caveat when authorized by security classification guides or other properly marked source documents. 2 NOFORN shall not be applied to nonintelligence information unless explicitly allowed by a DoD level instruction. 5. REMARKING PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED MATERIALS. The remarking of material classified under previous DoD issuances is not required. However if such information is extracted from that material and placed in a new document or republished it must be marked according to current requirements. 6. LETTERS OF TRANSMITTAL a. Classified Letters of Transmittal. If the letter of transmittal itself contains classified information mark the letter with the highest classification and all SCI codeword\u2019s caveats and control markings that appear on the letter or the enclosures. Include appropriate paragraph markings and classification blocks i.e. the Derived From and Declassify On lines. Place the following notation above the classification line at the bottom of the first page of the letter REGRADE AS Insert classification caveatscode words and control markings as applicable to the transmittal lettermemorandum only. WHEN SEPARATED FROM ENCLOSURES AND UPON PHYSICAL REMOVAL OF APPROPRIATE SCI CAVEATS CODEWORDS AND CONTROL MARKINGS. b. Unclassified Letters of Transmittal. If a letter of transmittal itself is unclassified but has one or more SCI enclosures mark the letter with the highest classification and all SCI code words caveats and control markings of the enclosures or the letter. Place the following notation DoDM 5105.21V1 October 19 2012 Change 1 05162018 ENCLOSURE 4 26 above the classification line at the bottom of the first page of the letter REGRADE AS UNCLASSIFIED WHEN SEPARATED FROM ENCLOSURES AND UPON PHYSICAL REMOVAL OF APPROPRIATE SCI CAVEATS CODEWORDS AND CONTROL MARKINGS. c. When a letter of transmittal is separated from its enclosure follow the regrading instructions on the letter and downgrade as appropriate. 7. WORKING MATERIALS a. Date working materials when created and mark each page with the notation Working PapersDestroy Within 180 Days. b. Mark with the highest classification of any information contained therein safeguard working materials according to the handling storage and disposition requirements for non accountable SCI documents as described in this enclosure. c. When used informally as coordinating drafts or staff papers such materials may be physically transported or electronically transmitted via a secure means between action officers without marking as required for finished documents. 8. SPECIALIZED MEDIA a. Automated Information System AIS Media. Each media item e.g. CDs DVDs hard disk drives etc. containing SCI will be externally labeled as appropriate with an SF 712 or other identifying colorcoded markings in accordance with SF markings to show its classification and SCI control system caveats. Internal AIS media identification will include security markings in a form suitable for the media i.e. classification SCI system caveats and Reference y control markings if applicable. The introduction and removal of media from an SCI environment will be accounted for by document control procedures. All removable hard drives must be controlled and handled according to SCI document control procedures. b. ComputertoComputer Transmissions. SCI material transmitted by SCI approved and accredited AIS systems is considered controlled while in softcopy format. Once the SCI data is output to hardcopy format the printouts must be controlled as a hardcopy document. c. Photographic Media 1 Label or color code photography in roll flat digital memory card or other form with its classification and SCI control system caveats or code words. For film in roll form place the label on the end of the spool flange on the side of the spool container and on the container cover if any. If the container and its cover are transparent no label is needed if the flange label is visible through the container. The roll film will include head and tail sequences giving all security markings applicable to its contents. DoDM 5105.21V1 October 19 2012 Change 1 05162018 ENCLOSURE 4 27 2 Mark positive film flats or slides with individual internal markings showing the classification and SCI and other control markings. Label the front and back of frames for slides and view graphs with the classification and required markings which may be abbreviated if necessary to fit the space provided. When feasible photographically burn the classification and caveats into the print slide or image itself. 3 Protect and process undeveloped exposed film and imagery at the highest level of SCI security protection required by its contents. d. Video Tapes Digital Video Discs or Movie Film. These media will contain the classification and control information at the beginning and end of the media presentation. Label containers as well as the media itself to show the title date security classification SCI caveats code words and dissemination control markings and classification authority block. e. Microform Microfiche and Microfilm Media. Handle and control these media as a hardcopy document. Label containers as well as the media itself to show the title date security classification SCI caveats and code words and dissemination control markings and classification authority block. f. Marking in the Electronic Environment 1 Where special provisions for marking some types of computergenerated information are needed identify as clearly as possible the information that requires protection and the level of protection it requires and make available either on the item or by other means the other required information. 2 Classified information resident in an electronic environment is subject to all of the requirements of References l and k and shall be a Marked with the required classification markings to the extent that such markings are practical including banner line with overall classification and control markings portion markings and classification authority block. b Marked with the required classification markings when appearing in or as part of an electronic output e.g. database query so that users of the information will be alerted to the classification status of the information. c Marked in accordance with derivative classification procedures maintaining traceability of classification decisions to the OCA. In cases where classified information in an electronic environment cannot be marked in this manner a warning shall be applied to alert users that the information may NOT be used as a source for derivative classification and providing a point of contact and instructions on how to obtain further guidance on use and classification of the information. DoDM 5105.21V1 October 19 2012 Change 1 05162018 ENCLOSURE 4 28 d Prohibited from use as source of derivative classification if the information is dynamic in nature e.g. wikis and blogs and is not marked as required by References l and k and this Volume. 3 All email blog and wiki entries bulletin board posting and other electronic messages shall be marked as finished documents in accordance with the requirements of this enclosure. 4 Some organizations use automated tools to mark electronic messages e.g. organizational messages emails and text or instant messages. It remains the individual\u2019s responsibility to properly mark classified messages including banner marking portion markings and classification authority block when an automated tool is used. 5 Where fanfolded printouts are used classification markings on interior pages may be applied by the information system or equipment even though the markings may not meet the normal test of being conspicuous. Dissemination control markings and the classification authority block shall either be marked on the face of the document or be placed on a separate sheet of paper attached to the front of the document. Segments of such printouts removed for separate use or maintenance shall be marked as individual documents. g. Graphic Arts Material. Mark all visual aids to include Power Point slides maps artwork blueprints and such other material with the security classification and SCI control system or code words before the legend title block scale bullets and at the top and bottom in such a manner as to be reproduced on all copies. Classification authority and declassification instructions shall be on the first page of the graphic arts material. 9. FAX CONTROL PROCEDURES. The secure fax machine used within the SCIF must be approved and accredited for the appropriate classification and access level of the material processed. Individuals transmitting and receiving the material shall have the appropriate clearance SCI accesses and need to know. a. SCI documents transmitted by secure fax shall be marked and controlled in the same manner as hardcopy documents. b. Individual header or cover sheets used to precede the transmission of SCI material by secure fax shall be conspicuously marked with the highest security classification of the transmitted material and unclassified digraphstrigraphs handling caveats and Reference y control markings. The cover sheet will include the originator\u2019s name organization and phone number the subject in unclassified form the number of pages and the receiver\u2019s name organization and phone number. 10. COVER SHEETS. Cover sheets shall be used on SCI documents upon removal from security containers or SCIFs to guard against unauthorized disclosure. Cover sheets should also be used when an SCI document is not actively being used in an open storage environment. DoDM 5105.21V1 October 19 2012 Change 1 05162018 ENCLOSURE 4 29 Cover sheets shall show by color which SCI control system or combination of systems applies the classification and applicable markings. Cover sheets should use the appropriate unclassified digraphs and trigraphs instead of the SCI code words. Cover sheets shall never display classified information e.g. code words caveats. Use normal forms distribution channels to order SCI cover sheets . Local color reproduction and overprinting of cover sheets are permissible. SCI cover sheets can be downloaded from the DIA website at httpwww.dia.ic.govhomepagesecurity.html provided there is color print capability. 11. SCI ACCOUNTABILITY a. General. The use of document numbers and other similar systems to provide accountability for individual SCI documents as a security protection measure is no longer required except for material specifically designated as accountable SCI. b. NonAccountable SCI. SI TK and G material has been designated as nonaccountable SCI. HCS material is nonaccountable unless determined otherwise by the HCS Secretariat. c. Accountable SCI. Accountable SCI is determined by the DNI or HICE to be of such critical sensitivity as to require the most stringent protection methods including traceability and audit. The DNI or HICE shall approve such document accountability in writing. This authority may not be delegated. d. Inventories of Accountable SCI. HICE or their designee shall maintain the annual inventory of accountable SCI. 1 All DoD Components will honor the designation of accountable SCI. 2 An annual report of accountable authorizations volume and cost may be required at the request of the DNI. 3 Accountability records are not required for nonaccountable SCI. Intelligence information that has not yet been converted into finished intelligence is considered non accountable SCI. a Records for Incoming Accountable SCI. A record shall be kept of accountable SCI and shall identify the material by document accountability number and copy number originator and a brief description of the material and storage location. Keeping copies of receipts or maintaining other records that provide required identifying data satisfy this requirement. For electronic records retention of standard telecommunications center records fulfill this requirement. Internal receipting or administrative controls within the same SCIF is not required. b Records for Outgoing Accountable SCI. A receipt is required for accountable SCI. Receipts shall identify the material by accountability number copy number and originator contain a brief unclassified description of the material and identify the recipient. The required DoDM 5105.21V1 October 19 2012 Change 1 05162018 ENCLOSURE 4 30 DCD pouch or package receipt kept by the sender is sufficient to fulfill this requirement. The originator is responsible for preparing receipts for SCI material. c Records Retention. For accountable SCI e.g. SAP material retain records of incoming and outgoing accountable SCI such as receipts and document control logs and certificates of destruction as permanent records see paragraph 19.b. of this Enclosure. For non accountable SCI transmission receipts may be destroyed on acknowledgment of successful transmission to the intended recipient. 12. SCI DOCUMENT ACCOUNTABILITY NUMBER a. Assign an accountability number to accountable SCI material only. Accountability numbers are not required for SCI documents unless explicitly required by program specific guidance. b. Assign copy numbers to individual documents. Place the copy number next to or near the control number at the lower right corner of the document. Show reproduced copies with a combination of digits and letters e.g. Copy 1A Copy 4C or identify the copy as Series B Series C etc. c. The HICE or designee may designate special control numbers for contractororiginated SCI. 13. STORAGE. SCI material shall be maintained and stored in an accredited SCIF. a. Combinations and codes to access control devices should be given to a limited number of SCIindoctrinated personnel consistent with effective SCIF operations. Combinations to locks installed on security containers perimeter doors and any other openings must be changed 1 When a combination is first installed or used. 2 When a combination has been compromised or believed to have been compromised. 3 At other times when considered necessary by the SSO. 4 When taken out of service combination locks shall be reset to the standard combination 502550. b. Codes to access control devices cipher electronic etc. shall be provided only to SCI indoctrinated personnel. c. When practical SCI material should be segregated from other material in a separate file cabinet drawer or folder. Security regulations or directives governing collateral files do not apply to SCI material. DoDM 5105.21V1 October 19 2012 Change 1 05162018 ENCLOSURE 4 31 d. U.S. collateral classified information used in a SCIF shall be stored in accordance with the SCIF accreditation and managed in accordance with the guidance in Reference k. 14. TEMPORARY RELEASE OUTSIDE OF A SCIF. In Government facilities when operational needs require the release of SCI for temporary use by SCIindoctrinated persons in nonSCI accredited areas only the CSA their designee or the Component SIO may grant such release. In a combat zone the force commander or local SIO may authorize temporary release under emergency conditions. The SCI security official shall obtain a signed receipt for SCI released in this manner and ensure that conditions of use of the released material provide adequate security to include acoustic and visual protection until the SCI is returned to a SCIF by the end of the duty day. SCI material shall not be left with nonSCIindoctrinated personnel. This does not preclude transporting of properly wrapped SCI by DCD or U.S. Diplomatic Courier Service personnel. If temporary release is needed for more than one or two occasions consideration should be given to establishing a permanent SCIF. This temporary release authority is not intended to remove the requirement to use a properly accredited SCIF in day to day situations. 15. REPRODUCTION. Reproduction of SCI documents shall be kept to a minimum consistent with operational necessity. Within a SCIF reproduction equipment must display the classification levels and SCI authorized for reproduction by each piece of reproduction equipment. a. Stated prohibitions or limitations against reproduction shall be honored. The originator is the approval authority for reproduction in such cases. b. Copies of documents are subject to the same control accountability and destruction procedures as the original documents. Extracts of documents shall be marked according to content and treated as working materials. c. Equipment connected to remote diagnostic centers such as by telephone lines are prohibited for SCI reproduction unless the capability has been disabled. 16. TRANSPORTATION OF SCI INFORMATION a. General Provisions. Alternately SCI shall be transferred by SCI indoctrinated persons certified or designated couriers diplomatic pouch or DCD. The SSO or SCI Security Official shall establish strict accountability and control for courier cards. 1 The preferred method of transporting SCI from one SCIF to another shall be via secure email or other secure electronic means. Alternatively SCI shall be transported by SCI indoctrinated persons certified or designated couriers diplomatic pouch or DCD. See section 17 of this enclosure for specific wrapping instructions. DoDM 5105.21V1 October 19 2012 Change 1 05162018 ENCLOSURE 4 32 2 When transporting SCI within a single building military headquarters or DoD controlled building SCI material shall be placed in a locked brief case or locked pouch made of canvas or other heavyduty material and must have an integral keyoperated lock. The briefcase or pouch shall bear a subtle notice indicating that anyone finding the container unattended must notify the owner immediately and to arrange to return it unopened to the owner.

SCI couriers are responsible for the protection of the material in their custody. Couriers must avoid all places situations and circumstances that could compromise their ability to protect the classified material. Couriers have discharged their responsibilities once they have released the material to the authorized recipient in the SSO at their destination. 2. All SCI materials shall be doublewrapped. A locked briefcase or pouch should serve as the outer wrapper. Attach a courier tag to the outer envelope of each parcel containing classified information. Do not attach a courier tag to the outside of a briefcase attach\u00e9 case etc. or to a carton or container being escorted as this would draw attention to the classified material. The inner wrappers must be marked or labeled as indicated in Figure 2 Figure 2. Marking Inner Wrappers of Classified Material. 3. Opaque envelopes or wrapping paper or tamperevident packaging shall be used for the inner wrappers all seams are to be taped with reinforced paperplastic tape or tamperevident tape.

The shipping of SCI in cartons and containers that are too large to handcarry aboard commercial passenger aircraft and must be placed in the aircraft\u2019s sealed cargo compartment is highly discouraged. If the SCI cannot be kept in the possession of the courier at all times then it should be shipped via DCD on military air. If the transport is approved the SSO who has authorized the transport of the SCI will notify the appropriate air carrier in advance. The courier will report to the affected airline ticket counter before boarding present hisher documentation and the package or cartons to be exempt from screening. The airline representative will review the documentation and description of the containers to be exempt. If satisfied with the identification of the courier and his documentation the official will provide the passenger with an escort to the screening station and authorize the screening personnel to exempt the container from physical or other type inspection. The actual loading and unloading of the SCI will be under the supervision of a representative of the air carrier however appropriately cleared personnel will accompany the classified information and keep it under surveillance during loading and unloading operations. In addition appropriately cleared personnel to include the courier must be available to conduct surveillance at any intermediate stops where the cargo compartment is to be opened. If the airline official is not satisfied with the identification of the passenger or the authenticity of his documentation the courier will not be permitted to board and not be subject to further screening for boarding purposes. These types of arrangements require prior coordination with the airlines. 6. SCI handcarried aboard commercial passenger airlines must be accomplished only aboard a U.S. carrier. Foreign carriers will be used only when no U.S. carrier is available. If a foreign carrier is used the information must remain in the custody and physical control of the U.S. courier at all times. 7. Couriers shall use the most direct route feasible. If a courier is unable to follow the itinerary or if the material is lost stolen or otherwise subjected to compromise en route the courier will immediately report the circumstances to the parent SSO. Handcarrying SCI on trips that involve an overnight stop is not permissible without advance arrangements for secure overnight storage in a U.S. Government facility that is accredited to store SCI. Within the United States a cleared contractor SCIF that has the requisite storage capability may be used. If an overnight stop or unforeseen delay is encountered while en route and an accredited facility is not available the material may be stored at a DCD courier transfer station CTS if available. If a CTS is used for overnight storage a signed receipt will be obtained. If none of these facilities is available the courier must retain the material in their personal possession and properly safeguard it during the period of delay. 8. SCI will not be read studied displayed discussed or used in any manner in public conveyances or places. Do not discuss SCI except in secure areas officially approved for such discussion. All personnel having access to or viewing the material must be authorized the appropriate level of SCI access. 9. SCI documents must be returned to SSO control as soon as possible. Local couriers must return material to SSO control prior to the close of business on the day of receipt unless prior arrangements are made. Couriers will verify each item by the package pouch or in the case of individual documents control number when receipting for or delivering material. SCI material DoDM 5105.21V1 October 19 2012 Change 1 05162018 APPENDIX 3 TO ENCLOSURE 4 43 will be delivered only to the specific addressees designated by the dispatching unit. Positive identification will be obtained before release of the material. Couriers will neither reproduce nor permit reproduction of SCI material without prior approval of organization SSO. 10. SCI shall not be handcarried across international borders unless the home station activity issuing the written authorization is reasonably certain that the SCI will not be opened by foreign customs border postal or other inspectors either U.S. or foreign. 11. Envelopes containing SCI should not be used to carry or convey personal items communications or other similar objects. 12. Round trip handcarrying of SCI is the exception rather than the rule. If the SCI is to be returned to the home station it should be transmitted back from the travel destination by secure means. 13. SCI material shall be stored with a servicing SSO at the TDY location and provided to that SSO for wrapping controlling and shipping by DCD to home station. If material must be transported roundtrip the SSO at the TDY location will wrap and control material before remanding to the courier\u2019s custody. 14. Federal Aviation Regulations require that all passengers and their carryon items be screened before boarding military or commercial aircraft. Couriers of SCI should routinely offer briefcases or pouches for inspection. The courier letter or order may be offered if requested. The contents of briefcases and pouches may be allowed to go through metal detection devices unopened. In the event that the person conducting the screening is not satisfied and there is doubt as to the contents of the envelopes the courier will not be permitted to board with the briefcases or pouches. Never allow screening personnel to open envelopes containing classified material. Envelopes containing SCI must be free of metal binders clips or other metallic objects that might trigger air terminal screening devices. If the envelopes are contained in a briefcase or carryonluggage the briefcase or luggage may be opened for inspection for weapons or contraband. The screening officials may check envelopes by xray machine flexing feel and weight. In the event that the courier is not allowed to board the aircraft they shall contact the authorizing SSO for instructions. 15. The courier appointment does not authorize the bearer to carry SCI material to their home or office for personal convenience. Recurring or blanket courier letters for commercial air are not authorized. Local SCI security officials shall not grant authority to nonassigned personnel to handcarry SCI without prior permission of their parent agency organization service or unit. 16. Noncompliance with the foregoing may be grounds for disciplinary action. DoDM 5105.21V1 October 19 2012 Change 1 05162018 ENCLOSURE 5 44 ENCLOSURE 5 TRANSMISSION SECURITY 1. ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION OF SCI. Senders transmitting SCI electronically including facsimile computer secure voice email or any other means of telecommunication must ensure that such transmissions are made only to authorized recipients. Recipients will provide proper protection for SCI received. Electronic transmission of SCI is limited to specifically designated and accredited communications circuits secured by an NSAapproved cryptographic system or a protected distribution system accredited in accordance with Enclosure 4 of Volume 2. a. SCI regardless of its classification shall not be processed on transferred to or stored on SIPRNETconnected or unclassified information systems. b. Any transfer to andor processing or storage of SCI on SIPRNET or an unclassified system constitutes an unauthorized disclosure and must be reported in accordance with those procedures. The SSO shall contact and work with the information assurance staff to ensure appropriate and timely resolution of the incident. 2. SECURITY RESPONSIBILITIES. The local SSO is responsible for ensuring that supporting communications centers establish and implement appropriate security and control procedures to protect the categories of SCI and that all personnel are familiar with these procedures. Individuals are responsible for ensuring that message addressees are authorized to receive the category of SCI or multiple control system information to be transmitted. Any variation from the prescribed security standards for transmission of SCI by electrical means will be referred to SSO DIADAC. 3. COMSEC TRAINING PROGRAMS. Only properly trained individuals are authorized to operate cryptographic equipment. The DoD Components will ensure that personnel in cryptographic operations maintenance and other COMSEC specialties receive the required training to perform their duties. 4. GUIDELINES. The following is the minimum criteria for an electrical circuit transmitting SCI a. A circuit not including an NSAsponsored circuit between two or more SCI facilities except for Protected Distribution Systems PDSs must be validated by DIA in accordance with Department of the Interior Acquisition Regulation 352 Reference ad. Retain the circuit validation documentation within the SCIF for which it was validated. b. SCIFs must be accredited to the same level of SCI transmitted or received on electrical circuits entering or exiting the SCIF. The construction and protection of SCI DoDM 5105.21V1 October 19 2012 Change 1 05162018 ENCLOSURE 5 45 telecommunications facilities will be in accordance with Reference t and NACSI 4000series or successor publications. c. Personnel having access to the SCI unencrypted data on the circuit or personnel responsible for SCI encryption equipment must be SCIindoctrinated to the appropriate level to minimize risk while still only granting access to sensitive programs when appropriate. d. All equipment and associated transmission lines at each end of the circuit handling plain text unencrypted SCI must be installed in accredited SCI facilities. The term equipment as used in this paragraph refers to all electrical and electromechanical devices used to handle plain text information including but not limited to endterminal equipment patches interface units automated switches multiplexers and computer systems. e. COMSEC equipment and cryptographic systems must be NSAapproved for the highest level of classification of the traffic transmitted on the system. f. All equipment including COMSEC and associated unencrypted transmission lines must be installed in accordance with Reference m. g. All equipment and PDSs must be accredited in accordance with Enclosure 4 of Volume 2. 5. COLLATERAL CIRCUITS WITHIN SCI AREAS. Communications command and control or intelligence data circuits that are not approved for the transmission of SCI will not be installed within a SCIF without the consent of the SCIF IA approval authority in accordance with section 6 of this enclosure. Additionally such systems must be installed in a manner that preserves the communications and physical security integrity of collocated SCI systems and circuits and meets TEMPEST requirements. 6. APPROVAL AUTHORITY a. The HICEs of the Military Departments and Command Level SIOs or CSAs following the guidelines in section 4 of this enclosure may authorize installation of collateral circuits in SCI facilities under their security cognizance. DAC shall be notified of all collateral circuits installed in SCIFs. b. The HICEs of the Military Departments and Command Level SIOs and CSAs may grant temporary approval to transmit SCI over a circuit or protected distribution system. This approval shall be documented in writing with a signature. DIA may further delegate temporary approval authority for DoD Field Activities. Prior to granting interim approval the approving authority must assess the risk and measures taken to manage the risk. Temporary approval shall not exceed 30 days operational restrictions will be imposed as required. All circuits containing residual SCI e.g. hard drives routers key material must be properly secured in an accredited SCIF or continuously protected by SCI personnel when not in use. Commanders will notify DAC of interim approvals. DoDM 5105.21V1 October 19 2012 Change 1 05162018 ENCLOSURE 5 46 7. MULTIFUNCTION OFFICE MACHINES MFOMs. MFOMs are devices that have the capability to copy print scan and fax either in a standalone or networked mode. When connected to a network MFOM devices assume the highest classification for which the network is accredited. If operated as a standalone or multifunction device these devices assume the highest classification of copied documents. Many MFOM hard drives are capable of holding thousands of images depending on the size and complexity of the images. The SSO shall establish written procedures to protect the information contained within the hard drive and printed circuit boardsmemory boards of the MFOM. a. All external data connections must be disabled when MFOMs are used to process i.e. scan copy print or fax classified information. Some MFOMs have the capability to allow the vendor to receive copies of documents i.e. 1 of every 100 through hardware or wireless transmission mediums whether scanned printed copied or faxed to maintain quality control of the MFOM these features must be disconnected or disabled. b. To prevent the inadvertent or deliberate downloading of classified information service technicians shall not connect a proprietary laptop to an MFOM that processes classified information. Laptops required for diagnostics must be purchased by the command or agency software included and maintained by the SSO in the SCIF. The hard drive printed circuit boards or memory boards and like memory storage devices cannot be removed from the SCIF to a nonSCIF area unless the device is properly sanitized of all classified or sensitive information. The classified information stored on the hard drive is the property of the United States and must not be released outside official channels. For this reason all MFOM hard drives and printed circuit boards or memory boards Government or lease must be removed prior to their final disposition. c. Purchased MFOMs are Government property. Turning them into the Defense Reutilization Management Office without a hard drive is acceptable provided all printed circuit boards or memory boards are removed. Leased MFOMs may need to be returned in working order at the conclusion of the lease. In this instance a second hard drive should be purchased. The builtin internal hard drive may be extremely difficult to access and remove requiring disassembly. For this reason leasing the MFOM with a removable hard drive vice an internal fixed hard drive is recommended. Printed circuit cards or memory boards will be removed prior to returning the MFOM to the vendor. d. Removal or return of purely mechanical or electromechanical parts to a vendor will only be permitted based on a risk determination that includes consideration of threat vulnerability impact and cost. Printed circuit boards or memory boards are to be destroyed as classified trash at the classification level as determined in this enclosure. No parts will be released outside the United States or in areas with a high foreign intelligence or terrorist threat. e. All communications ports not specifically required for networked or contractual maintenance must be removed or permanently disabled. Only hardwired connections are permitted. IR RF video or audio communications are prohibited. This provision must be included in the purchase contract. DoDM 5105.21V1 October 19 2012 Change 1 05162018 ENCLOSURE 5 47 8. SECURE TELEPHONE DEVICES a. In accordance with DoDI 8560.01 Reference ae all telephones subject to COMSEC monitoring will display DD Form 2056 Telephone Monitoring Notification Decal. b. The CryptoIgnition Key for a Secure Telephone Unit STU III telephone or a Fortezza CardKOV14 for a Secure Terminal Equipment STE telephone located in SCIFs is configured by the NSA Electronic Key Management System Central Facility. Secure telephones configured with a TOP SECRET SCI key shall not be used in nonSCI accredited areas. c. Telephones configured with a residential or mobile key can provide a limited capability for senior leaders and decision makers to receive secure calls.

Reference v establishes the security policy and procedures for storing processing and communicating classified intelligence information in IC. The IC seeks standardization of IS security policy and procedures. The physical personnel and information security practices and procedures described in this Manual must accommodate a wide range of information system security concepts and requirements. Information system security and the achievement of information assurance are linked with and dependent upon all other security disciplines. a. All DoD Intelligence Information Systems DoDIIS must be certified and accredited in accordance with References u v and this Manual. Joint Air ForceArmyNavy JAFANs regulations for SAP may also pertain to certain IS. b. Unclassified or collateral nonSCI networked IS collocated in DIA SCIFs will be considered guest systems and their currently approved accreditation accepted. SCI security personnel will ensure IS security policies are in place to provide a continued safe SCIF IS operating environment and establish a mechanism for the SCI IA approval authority for these actions. SSOs and security personnel should reference other guidance as required such as DoDD 8500.01E Reference ah and DoDIs 8500.2 DoDIs 8500.01 and 8510.01 References ah and ai and aj. c. All DoD IS must maintain an appropriate level of integrity authentication non repudiation availability and confidentiality. d. As the information system conditions and features are designed and implemented it is important to consider 1 The importance and sensitivity of the information and information assets. 2 Documented threats and vulnerabilities. 3 The trustworthiness of users and interconnecting systems. 4 The impact of impairment or destruction to the DoD information system. 5 Cost effectiveness of security features or selected countermeasures. e. Every DoDIIS must be accredited either as a separately accredited system or as part of an accredited DoDIIS site.

The classified information stored on the hard drive is the property of the United States and must not be released outside official channels. For this reason all MFOM hard drives and printed circuit boards or memory boards Government or lease must be removed prior to their final disposition. c. Purchased MFOMs are Government property. Turning them into the Defense Reutilization Management Office without a hard drive is acceptable provided all printed circuit boards or memory boards are removed. Leased MFOMs may need to be returned in working order at the conclusion of the lease. In this instance a second hard drive should be purchased. The builtin internal hard drive may be extremely difficult to access and remove requiring disassembly. For this reason leasing the MFOM with a removable hard drive vice an internal fixed hard drive is recommended. Printed circuit cards or memory boards will be removed prior to returning the MFOM to the vendor. d. Removal or return of purely mechanical or electromechanical parts to a vendor will only be permitted based on a risk determination that includes consideration of threat vulnerability impact and cost. Printed circuit boards or memory boards are to be destroyed as classified trash at the classification level as determined in this enclosure. No parts will be released outside the United States or in areas with a high foreign intelligence or terrorist threat. e.

In addition, individuals shall report any unauthorized disclosure or \nexposure of SCI that might reasonably be expected to result in the publication of SCI in the \npublic media such as newspapers, books, television, radio, and internet blogs.  \nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 3 \n17 \nENCLOSURE 3 \nGENERAL PROCEDURES \n1. GENERAL\na. Users should refer to DCIDs, ICDs, intelligence community (IC) policy memorandums\nand guidance, DoD issuances, the Signals Intelligence Security Regulation (Reference (m)), \nNational Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Advisory \nMemorandum (NSTISSAM) 2-95 (Reference (n)), and other documents cited herein for \nguidance on classification level, compartmentalization, decompartmentalization, sanitization, \nrelease to foreign governments, emergency use, and additional security policy and procedures for \nthe protection of information controlled in SCI compartments. \nb. Recommendations on SCI policy changes made by the DoD SCI security community shall\nbe raised at the SCIPCCOM.  This committee, chaired by the Chief, DIA DAC or designee, is \ncomposed of senior SCI security policy representatives of the USD(I) and the Military \nDepartments.  This committee shall meet at least semi-annually and the chairperson shall \nforward recommendations to the security directors of DIA and the Military Departments for \npresentation to the DNI Special Security Center as appropriate. \nc. Information sharing has become a critical component of providing our war fighters the\nrequired intelligence information when needed.  ICD 501 (Reference (o)) sets forth guidance on \nsharing intelligence information.  The goal of information sharing is to provide appropriately \ncleared customers (i.e., those with the necessary clearance, access approval, and need to know) \nwith all the intelligence information they need to fulfill their missions. \nd. The procedures set forth in this Volume are the standards for protecting SCI.  The DoD\nComponents shall not establish or disseminate operational or administrative procedures \ninconsistent with the security standards prescribed herein.  HICE may impose more stringent \nprocedures if they believe extraordinary conditions and circumstances warrant. \ne. In emergencies or when there is a danger of compromise, the DoD Components and DoD\ncontractors are authorized to communicate directly with the DAC concerning SCI policy matters. \nAll other matters should be resolved through the established chain of command.  \nf. During hostilities, wartime, or exercise conditions, the authority and reporting channels for\nSCI security cognizance shall run parallel to the theater command and operational lines of \nauthority.  This procedure exists because staff oversight of SCI security is the direct \nresponsibility of the SIO responsible for the theater.  The SSO of the Combatant Command has \nSCI security cognizance for units deployed in the Combatant Command\u2019s theater of operations. \ng. Service Cryptologic Components, those Military Service elements that are assigned to the\nCSS, are under the direction and management of the Director, NSA/Chief, CSS, for physical, \nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 3 \n18 \nTEMPEST, and IS security matters.  Any SCI policy conflict shall be resolved by negotiation \nbetween the Military Department and NSA. \n2. RISK MANAGEMENT\na. SCI security officials shall employ the principles of risk management and risk-based\nanalysis when developing and implementing protective measures.  Risk-based analysis should \nprovide for increased efficiency of operations and co-utilization of facilities wherever practical.  \nSCI security officials shall request waivers to SCI security policy from their respective CSAs and \njustify the need for deviation from established security methods. \nb. SCI security officials shall obtain a threat assessment of the current criminal, espionage,\nsabotage, subversion, and terrorist threat situation from their supporting law enforcement agency \nand counterintelligence support office or equivalent.  Security countermeasures to meet these \nthreats shall be tailored based on risk management.   \n3. DIRECT REPORTING/COMMUNICATIONS AUTHORIZED.  Each DoD Component shall\nestablish procedures for SCI security officials to communicate directly with the appropriate\nHICE or designee on emergency matters that affect plans or operations when there is a danger of\ncompromise and the established chain of command cannot be followed.  SCI security officials\nunder the cognizance of the SSO DIA security authority may communicate directly with the SSO\nDAC on emergency matters where SCI is in imminent danger of compromise.  At all other times,\nSCI security officials shall follow their chain of command for the processing of SCI-related\nmatters.  Contractors shall go through the contracting officer to the organization that issued the\ncontract.\n4. PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION\na. SCI shall not be published, released to, or discussed with, unauthorized persons or the\npublic media.  HICEs shall not authorize declassification of SCI for public release without the \nprior written approval of the appropriate DNI security executive agent.  Requests for such \ndeclassification action shall be forwarded through command SCI security channels to the \nappropriate DNI executive agent.  Requests for news media information shall be forwarded \nthrough the appropriate command SCI security channels to the appropriate HICE or designee. \nb. Unauthorized disclosure of SCI (disclosure that has not been approved for release by the\nHICE or appropriate DNI security executive agent) in public media does not alter the basic \nsecurity policies and procedures contained in this Manual or the information\u2019s original \nclassification.  Such information remains classified.  Individuals are not relieved of their \nobligation to maintain the secrecy of such information and are bound by the provisions of SF \n312, \u201cClassified Information Nondisclosure Agreement,\u201d and DD Form 1847-1, \u201cSensitive \nCompartmented Information Nondisclosure Statement.\u201d  No additional facts, amplification, or \ncomments shall be made about unauthorized disclosures of classified information.   \nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 3 \n19 \n5. FOREIGN DISCLOSURE.  The provisions of this section shall not be waived.\na. All classified intelligence information intended for release outside the originating agency\nshall be explicitly marked with at least one of the authorized, mandatory foreign release \nmarkings (Releasable by Intelligence Disclosure Official (RELIDO), Releasable to (REL TO), or \nNot Releasable to Foreign Nationals (NOFORN)) or FOR DISPLAY ONLY to assist customers \nin information sharing. \nb. SCI may be disclosed or released to foreign governments and international organizations\nin one of two ways: \n(1) As SCI, in accordance with DCID 6/7 (Reference (p)), pursuant to a DNI-approved\nbilateral or multilateral agreement or arrangement; or \n(2) As sanitized, or otherwise altered, SCI-derived information at the collateral level\nafter approval by a duly authorized foreign disclosure officer in accordance with National \nDisclosure Policy (Reference (q)).  \nc. Reference (p) provides Intelligence Community policy and procedures for the disclosure\nand  release of SCI and classified intelligence to foreign governments and international \norganizations, and coalition partners consisting of sovereign states. \n(1) Disclosure or release of SCI beyond existing DNI policy guidance must be\ncoordinated with the originator of the information and the Assistant DNI for Policy and Strategy. \n(2) Any release of SCI to foreign governments must be approved by the SCI originator.\n(3) SCI shall not be disclosed to other foreign entities without approval from the DNI,\nhis designee, or the HICE, as appropriate. \n(4) Release of SCI-related, unclassified technology is subject to export controls as\nestablished by the DoD, Department of State, and Department of Commerce. \n6. PROTECTION OF SOURCES AND METHODS\na. DCID 6/6 (Reference (r)) establishes policy for the use of dissemination controls to\nmaximize the dissemination of intelligence consistent with national security requirements and \nthe need to protect sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.  Although dissemination \ncontrols are important tools in carrying out the DNI\u2019s statutory responsibilities to protect sources \nand methods, inappropriate use of such controls impedes efficient and timely access to \nintelligence information required to meet customer needs.  Therefore, all IC organizations will \napply dissemination controls judiciously to ensure the intelligence information is disseminated to \nthose who need it without unnecessary restrictions. \nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 3 \n20 \nb. Access to SCI is based on ICD 704 (Reference (s)) eligibility, need-to-know, formal\naccess approval, and indoctrination.  SCI will be disseminated at the lowest level of classification \nthat will satisfy official requirements. \nc. All DoD Components will ensure that the intelligence they produce and disseminate\nexcludes, sanitizes, or generalizes in descending order of preference the source and method data.  \nProducers of finished intelligence shall: \n(1) Avoid publishing products that must be controlled in collection system\ncompartments.  When treatment of a particular subject in an intelligence product requires \ndiscussion of operationally compartmented sources and methods, a special supplement, \nappropriately controlled in compartmented channels, is the preferred approach. \n(2) Ensure unavoidable references to intelligence sources or methods are as non-specific\nas practicable.  Subject to the provisions of collection system manuals, generalized discussion of \ncompartmented collection capabilities is permitted in finished intelligence products controlled in \na product-oriented compartment.  Discussion of collection gaps, capabilities to provide \nindications and warning intelligence, or advice on the reliability of sources in finished \nintelligence at a relatively low level of compartmentalization must not exceed allowable \nboundaries of SCI control and thereby risk exposure of particularly sensitive intelligence. \nd. The policy constraint on the use of compartmented information regarding sources and\nmethods in finished intelligence products applies to all DoD publications including formal and \ninformal memorandums and studies. \n7. STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOPs).  SCI security officials shall establish\nwritten SOPs as required for their individual operational environments.  The SSO shall ensure\nthat SOPs do not conflict with DNI, DoD, or Military Department regulatory guidance.  The SSO\nfor the facility to which the SOP applies and the contractor management official responsible for\nSCI shall review SOPs and forward to the SIO, Commander, delegated Component official, or\ncorporate official for approval.  The approving official shall thereafter review them annually and\ndocument the review in writing.  SOPs shall be part of the security orientation for personnel\nassigned to the areas to which the SOPs apply.\n8. POLICY WAIVERS\na. Except as otherwise stated, the HICEs may waive the provisions of this Manual under\nextraordinary circumstances.  The HICE may delegate this authority to the CSA.  Waivers will \nbe issued for a specific period, usually 1 year, or as otherwise specified by the waiver.  The \nrequester must correct the situation covered by the waiver prior to the expiration date or request \nan extension of the waiver.  The local SCI security official shall inform other agencies or \nservices desiring to share the facility of the waiver condition.  Exceptions to policy shall be kept \non file in the SSO and in the field unit SCIF, as applicable. \nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 3 \n21 \nb. Waivers for the physical or technical security of a SCIF shall be done in accordance with\nthe procedures outlined in ICD 705 (Reference (t)) and Volume 2 of this Manual. \nc. This Manual does NOT authorize the waiver of reporting requirements to law\nenforcement or counterintelligence agencies.  \n9. INSPECTIONS.  DIA/DAC is the authority for DoD SCIF inspections.  DAC is authorized to\ninspect periodically any DoD SCIF and direct action to correct any deficiency including removal\nof SCIF accreditation.  A physical inspection shall be conducted prior to accreditation by DAC\nor its designee as part of the accreditation process.  After accreditation, inspections will be\nconducted periodically and will be based on risk management principles.  Inspections shall be\nconducted in accordance with Reference (t), this Manual, and any other applicable DoD\nissuances.  At a minimum, the inspection will include SCI security policy and procedures,\nsecurity administration, information security, personnel security, physical security, technical\nsecurity, and IA.\na. Periodic inspections will be scheduled based on threat, sensitivity, physical modifications,\nand past security performance.  Inspections may occur at any time, announced or unannounced.  \nAdditional inspections may be conducted in the event of suspected compromise or incidents, \nhistory of deficiencies, major facility modification, or change in threat level. \nb. Authorized inspectors (See Glossary for definition) will be admitted to a SCIF without\ndelay or hindrance.  Government-owned inspection equipment will be admitted into a SCIF \nwithout delay. \nc. Inspectors will submit a written report following each inspection identifying any\ndeficiencies and corrective action to be taken.  The report will be forwarded to appropriate SCI \nofficials and a copy maintained within the inspected SCIF and by DAC.  Joint users of the SCIF \nwill accept the results of DIA security reviews for validation of security compliance.  These \nwritten reports will be available to the DNI or designee upon request. \nd. Staff assistance visits (SAVs) must be conducted to review security support actions and\nadministrative inquiries, and to support program review and approval as deemed appropriate by \nthe CSA.  Any recommendations that affect physical security, TEMPEST, or technical security \nwill be validated by DAC prior to corrective action or expenditure of funds.  When a report is \nissued by an SCI security official, findings and corrective actions are subject to review during the \nnext inspection. \ne. SCI security officials shall conduct self-inspections of their SCIFs annually and will use\nthe self-inspection checklist provided on the DIA/DAC Joint Worldwide Intelligence \nCommunication System(JWICS) webpage at \nhttp://www.dia.ic.gov/homepage/da/security/field/scifforms.html.  The purpose of the self-\ninspection is to ensure compliance with the policies and procedures contained in this Manual and \nother applicable SCI security regulations and directives.  Self-inspections will be coordinated \nwith the site IA manager (IAM) and will include the areas of SCI security policy and procedures, \nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 3 \n22 \nsecurity administration, information security, personnel security, physical security, technical \nsecurity (TEMPEST and TSCM), and IA.  SCI security officials will use the self-inspection \nchecklist provided on the DIA/ DAC webpage at \nhttp://www.dia.smil.mil/homepage/da/security/field.  Results of the inspections will be routed \nthrough the unit commander/COR to the Component SSO.  SCI security officials must specify in \nwriting all findings and corrective actions taken and retain the report until the next self-\ninspection.  An annual summary of self-inspection findings and actions will be forwarded to \nDIA/DAC-2 by the Military Department CSAs and Component SIOs. \nf. Only SCI-indoctrinated personnel knowledgeable of SCI policies may perform inspections\nof physical security, information security, personnel security, TEMPEST, security violations, \nsecurity education, visitor control procedures, and other requirements outlined in this Manual.  \nInspections by non-SCI indoctrinated entities is limited to the mission of the SCIF, collateral \nsecurity matters, anti-terrorism/force protection, counterintelligence, Operations Security, \nautomated information security, and those non-SCI command issues such as safety, fire \nmarshals, supply accountability, crime prevention, readiness, etc.  Such entities may also review \nthe facility\u2019s most recent self-inspection checklist to ensure that the self-inspection was \nconducted and make note of any discrepancies.  Only DIA can direct corrective action when an \nitem affects the physical or TEMPEST accreditation of the SCIF.   \n10. DIA COMPARTMENTED ADDRESS BOOK (CAB)\na. A CAB record contains the name of the organization, its major command, SCIF collateral\nmailing address, DCD address, DSSCS and GENSER plain language message addresses, contact \ninformation for the SCIF primary and alternate managers, and the security classification and \ncompartments the SCIF is authorized to receive and maintain.  CAB records also contain an area \nfor the SSO to list all elements they support.  The CAB record contains a large free text area for \nspecial instructions (such as how to pass clearances to the SSO) and another free text area for \nrecording JPAS designations.   \nb. SSOs shall submit changes to the CAB as they occur to their HICE or Component SIO via\nmessage or e-mail.  \nc. The HICEs are authorized to appoint individuals in their immediate organization to\ndirectly make these validated changes to the CAB.  Designations must be made via message to \nSSO DIA//EON-2A with the subject line CAB Validator Appointment.    \n11. IA.  DIA Directive 8500.002 (Reference (u)) and ICD 503 (Reference (v)) contain the policy\nand procedures pertaining to automated IS security for SCI.  The IA program was established to\nmaintain the security of intelligence IS and data stored, transmitted, and processed on these\nsystems.  IA officials will coordinate with the SSO on matters concerning IS/network security as\nneeded to provide full compliance with all applicable security directives.\nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 4 \n23 \nENCLOSURE 4 \nIS \n1. ORIGINATOR AND CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITIES\na. Originators.  The drafter of a document or other classified material is responsible for\nproperly complying with established security classification guidance and for properly applying \nthat guidance to the material, including all markings required for its protection, control, and \ndissemination.  Each individual is also responsible for ensuring SCI material is properly \nprotected.  All personnel who produce, transmit, reproduce, or extract SCI from documents or \nother materials must properly mark and protect the resulting SCI product.  They shall protect all \nhard copies, soft copies, and other related media (including, but not limited to, computer disks \nand typewriter ribbons) in the same manner as the final material and shall report errors in \nclassification and marking, control, or dissemination problems to the responsible SCI security \nofficial.  In addition they shall: \n(1) Include SCI in documents or products only when necessary to accomplish an\nessential official purpose and produce as few copies as necessary. \n(2) In developing SCI material, give primary consideration to the intended use of the\ninformation and organize the document, if possible, so that SCI can be disseminated separately \non a more limited basis such as in an annex or supplement.  Review the document before final \nproduction to ensure only the minimum scope and level of information essential to the task is \nincluded. \n(3) Produce SCI in a manner that will promote at all times positive control, safeguarding,\nand need-to-know access only. \nb. Contractors.  Contractors will ensure SCI information in their custody is used or retained\nonly in furtherance of a lawful and authorized U.S. Government purpose.  Contractors are \nrequired to return all SCI material to the COR, COTR, or Government program manager when \ntheir contract expires or closes out, unless the U.S. Government has given the contractor \npermission to retain the classified material in accordance with Chapter 5 of DoD 5220.22-M \n(Reference (w)).  This requirement must be included in item 13 or 14 of the DD Form 254.  The \ninformation management system employed by the contractor shall be capable of facilitating such \nretrieval and disposition in an expeditious manner. \n2. STANDARD CLASSIFICATION MARKINGS.  Classification and control markings shall be\napplied explicitly and uniformly when creating, disseminating, and using classified and\nunclassified information to maximize information sharing while protecting sources, methods, and\nactivities from unauthorized or unintentional disclosure.  Documents containing SCI shall be\nmarked in accordance with ICD 710 (Reference (x)).  Standard classification markings are\nmarkings that indicate the level of classification; the source of classification (and for original\nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 4 \n24 \nclassification decisions, the reason for classification); the agency and office of origin; and \ndowngrading and declassification instructions.  Also included are warnings notices (if \napplicable); intelligence control markings; portion markings; and page markings.  \na. Levels of Classification.  There are three levels of classification:  TOP SECRET,\nSECRET, and CONFIDENTIAL. \nb. Authority for Classification.  The classification authority designates the basis for\nclassification and is either an original or derivative. \n(1) Original Classification Authority (OCA).  OCA is the initial determination that\ninformation could be expected to cause damage to national security if subjected to unauthorized \ndisclosure.  This decision shall be made only by OCAs who have been specifically delegated the \nauthority to do so, have received training in the exercise of this authority, and have program \nresponsibility or cognizance over the information.  OCAs shall develop classification guides for \nsubject matter under his or her cognizance.  Original classification decisions made by an OCA \nshould be recorded in a security classification guide. \n(a) Reasons for Classifying.  To be eligible for classification, information must fall\nwithin one or more of the categories of information listed in section 1.4. of Reference (l).  The \n\u201cReason\u201d line is only used on documents originally classified by an OCA. \n(b) Duration of Classification.  At the time of original classification, the OCA shall\nestablish a specific date or event for declassification based upon the sensitivity of the national \nsecurity information.  Upon reaching the date or event, the information will automatically be \ndeclassified.   \n(2) Derivative Classification\n(a) The marking of the newly developed information is consistent with the\nclassification markings that apply to the originally classified source.  This includes the \nclassification of the information based on a security classification guide or source documents.  \nThe majority of classified information is produced by derivative classification.  The derivative \nclassifier shall maintain the identification of each source with the file or record copy of the \nderivatively classified document.  The derivative classifier shall include the source list in or with \nall copies of the derivatively classified document. \n(b) When preparing a new document from several classified documents, the marking\nwill reflect the highest classification of information extracted from the various source \ndocuments.   \n3. MARKING DOCUMENTS.  All classified information shall be clearly marked so as to leave\nno doubt as to the classification level, the reason for classification, the duration of classification,\nand the authority or source for classification.  Proper markings are required for both hard copy\nand electronic classified documents.  Guidance for the IC and DoD marking requirements and\nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 4 \n25 \nthe categories of classification and control markings can be found in Reference (k)), and the DNI \nCAPCO Authorized Classification and Control Markings Register (Reference (y)).  \n4. RESTRICTED DECLASSIFICATION VALUES AND CAVEATS\na. MANUAL REVIEW (MR).  The use of \u201cMR\u201d as a declassification value is no longer\nauthorized as specification of declassification values has been eliminated from the classification \nbanner lines of national intelligence documents.  The full textual description of the event, date \nfor declassification, or authorized exemption must be specified in the \nClassification/Declassification block on the first page of the classified document as required by \nparagraph 3.c of this enclosure.  \nb. NOFORN\n(1) The NOFORN caveat will only be applied to intelligence information in accordance\nwith References (p) and (r).  Only HICEs or OCAs in elements of the IC may determine what \ninformation warrants application of the NOFORN caveat.  Derivative classifiers shall only use \nthe caveat when authorized by security classification guides or other properly marked source \ndocuments.   \n(2) NOFORN shall not be applied to non-intelligence information unless explicitly\nallowed by a DoD level instruction. \n5. RE-MARKING PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED MATERIALS.  The re-marking of material\nclassified under previous DoD issuances is not required.  However, if such information is\nextracted from that material and placed in a new document or republished, it must be marked\naccording to current requirements.\n6. LETTERS OF TRANSMITTAL\na. Classified Letters of Transmittal.  If the letter of transmittal itself contains classified\ninformation, mark the letter with the highest classification and all SCI codeword\u2019s, caveats, and \ncontrol markings that appear on the letter or the enclosures.  Include appropriate paragraph \nmarkings and classification blocks (i.e., the \u201cDerived From\u201d and \u201cDeclassify On\u201d lines).  Place \nthe following notation above the classification line at the bottom of the first page of the letter: \nREGRADE AS (Insert classification, caveats/code words, and control markings as applicable to \nthe transmittal letter/memorandum only.) WHEN SEPARATED FROM ENCLOSURE(S) AND \nUPON PHYSICAL REMOVAL OF APPROPRIATE SCI CAVEATS, CODEWORDS, AND \nCONTROL MARKINGS. \nb. Unclassified Letters of Transmittal.  If a letter of transmittal itself is unclassified but has\none or more SCI enclosures, mark the letter with the highest classification and all SCI code \nwords, caveats, and control markings of the enclosures or the letter.  Place the following notation \nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 4 \n26 \nabove the classification line at the bottom of the first page of the letter: \u201cREGRADE AS \nUNCLASSIFIED WHEN SEPARATED FROM ENCLOSURE(S) AND UPON PHYSICAL \nREMOVAL OF APPROPRIATE SCI CAVEATS, CODEWORDS, AND CONTROL \nMARKINGS.\u201d \nc. When a letter of transmittal is separated from its enclosure, follow the regrading\ninstructions on the letter and downgrade as appropriate.  \n7. WORKING MATERIALS\na. Date working materials when created and mark each page with the notation \u201cWorking\nPapers--Destroy Within 180 Days.\u201d \nb. Mark with the highest classification of any information contained therein; safeguard\nworking materials according to the handling, storage, and disposition requirements for non-\naccountable SCI documents as described in this enclosure.   \nc. When used informally as coordinating drafts or staff papers, such materials may be\nphysically transported or electronically transmitted via a secure means between action officers \nwithout marking as required for finished documents. \n8. SPECIALIZED MEDIA\na. Automated Information System (AIS) Media.  Each media item (e.g. CDs, DVDs, hard\ndisk drives, etc.) containing SCI will be externally labeled, as appropriate, with an SF 712 or \nother identifying color-coded markings in accordance with SF markings, to show its \nclassification and SCI control system caveats.  Internal AIS media identification will include \nsecurity markings in a form suitable for the media (i.e., classification; SCI system caveats, and \nReference (y) control markings, if applicable).  The introduction and removal of media from an \nSCI environment will be accounted for by document control procedures.  All removable hard \ndrives must be controlled and handled according to SCI document control procedures.   \nb. Computer-to-Computer Transmissions.  SCI material transmitted by SCI approved and\naccredited AIS systems is considered controlled while in softcopy format.  Once the SCI data is \noutput to hardcopy format, the printouts must be controlled as a hardcopy document. \nc. Photographic Media\n(1) Label or color code photography in roll, flat, digital memory card, or other form with\nits classification and SCI control system caveats or code words.  For film in roll form, place the \nlabel on the end of the spool flange, on the side of the spool container, and on the container cover \n(if any).  If the container and its cover are transparent, no label is needed if the flange label is \nvisible through the container.  The roll film will include head and tail sequences giving all \nsecurity markings applicable to its contents. \nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 4 \n27 \n(2) Mark positive film flats or slides with individual internal markings showing the\nclassification and SCI and other control markings.  Label the front and back of frames for slides \nand view graphs with the classification and required markings, which may be abbreviated if \nnecessary to fit the space provided.  When feasible, photographically burn the classification and \ncaveats into the print, slide, or image, itself. \n(3) Protect and process undeveloped, exposed film and imagery at the highest level of\nSCI security protection required by its contents. \nd. Video Tapes, Digital Video Discs, or Movie Film.  These media will contain the\nclassification and control information at the beginning and end of the media presentation.  Label \ncontainers as well as the media itself to show the title; date; security classification; SCI caveats, \ncode words, and dissemination control markings; and classification authority block.   \ne. Microform, Microfiche, and Microfilm Media.  Handle and control these media as a\nhardcopy document.  Label containers as well as the media itself to show the title, date, security \nclassification, SCI caveats and code words and dissemination control markings, and \nclassification authority block. \nf. Marking in the Electronic Environment\n(1) Where special provisions for marking some types of computer-generated information\nare needed, identify as clearly as possible the information that requires protection and the level of \nprotection it requires, and make available either on the item or by other means, the other required \ninformation.   \n(2) Classified information resident in an electronic environment is subject to all of the\nrequirements of References (l) and (k) and shall be: \n(a) Marked with the required classification markings to the extent that such markings\nare practical, including banner line with overall classification and control markings, portion \nmarkings, and classification authority block. \n(b) Marked with the required classification markings when appearing in or as part of\nan electronic output (e.g., database query) so that users of the information will be alerted to the \nclassification status of the information.   \n(c) Marked in accordance with derivative classification procedures, maintaining\ntraceability of classification decisions to the OCA.  In cases where classified information in an \nelectronic environment cannot be marked in this manner, a warning shall be applied to alert users \nthat the information may NOT be used as a source for derivative classification and providing a \npoint of contact and instructions on how to obtain further guidance on use and classification of \nthe information. \nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 4 \n28 \n(d) Prohibited from use as source of derivative classification if the information is\ndynamic in nature (e.g., wikis and blogs) and is not marked as required by References (l) and (k) \nand this Volume. \n(3) All e-mail, blog and wiki entries, bulletin board posting, and other electronic\nmessages shall be marked as finished documents, in accordance with the requirements of this \nenclosure.  \n(4) Some organizations use automated tools to mark electronic messages (e.g.,\norganizational messages, e-mails, and text or instant messages).  It remains the individual\u2019s \nresponsibility to properly mark classified messages, including banner marking, portion markings, \nand classification authority block when an automated tool is used. \n(5) Where fan-folded printouts are used, classification markings on interior pages may be\napplied by the information system or equipment even though the markings may not meet the \nnormal test of being conspicuous.  Dissemination control markings and the classification \nauthority block shall either be marked on the face of the document or be placed on a separate \nsheet of paper attached to the front of the document.  Segments of such printouts removed for \nseparate use or maintenance shall be marked as individual documents.   \ng. Graphic Arts Material.  Mark all visual aids to include Power Point slides, maps, artwork,\nblueprints, and such other material with the security classification and SCI control system or \ncode words before the legend, title block, scale, bullets, and at the top and bottom in such a \nmanner as to be reproduced on all copies.  Classification authority and declassification \ninstructions shall be on the first page of the graphic arts material. \n9. FAX CONTROL PROCEDURES.  The secure fax machine used within the SCIF must be\napproved and accredited for the appropriate classification and access level of the material\nprocessed.  Individuals transmitting and receiving the material shall have the appropriate\nclearance, SCI accesses, and need to know.\na. SCI documents transmitted by secure fax shall be marked and controlled in the same\nmanner as hardcopy documents. \nb. Individual header or cover sheets used to precede the transmission of SCI material by\nsecure fax shall be conspicuously marked with the highest security classification of the \ntransmitted material and unclassified digraphs/trigraphs, handling caveats, and Reference (y) \ncontrol markings.  The cover sheet will include the originator\u2019s name, organization, and phone \nnumber; the subject in unclassified form; the number of pages; and the receiver\u2019s name, \norganization, and phone number.     \n10. COVER SHEETS.  Cover sheets shall be used on SCI documents upon removal from\nsecurity containers or SCIFs to guard against unauthorized disclosure.  Cover sheets should also\nbe used when an SCI document is not actively being used in an open storage environment.\nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 4 \n29 \nCover sheets shall show, by color, which SCI control system or combination of systems applies, \nthe classification, and applicable markings.  Cover sheets should use the appropriate unclassified \ndigraphs and trigraphs instead of the SCI code words.  Cover sheets shall never display classified \ninformation (e.g., code words, caveats).  Use normal forms distribution channels to order SCI \ncover sheets . Local color reproduction and overprinting of cover sheets are permissible.  SCI \ncover sheets can be downloaded from the DIA website at \nhttp://www.dia.ic.gov/homepage/security.html, provided there is color print capability. \n11. SCI ACCOUNTABILITY\na. General.  The use of document numbers and other similar systems to provide\naccountability for individual SCI documents as a security protection measure is no longer \nrequired except for material specifically designated as accountable SCI. \nb. Non-Accountable SCI.  SI, TK, and G material has been designated as non-accountable\nSCI.  HCS material is non-accountable unless determined otherwise by the HCS Secretariat.  \nc. Accountable SCI.  Accountable SCI is determined by the DNI or HICE to be of such\ncritical sensitivity as to require the most stringent protection methods, including traceability and \naudit.  The DNI or HICE shall approve such document accountability, in writing.  This authority \nmay not be delegated. \nd. Inventories of Accountable SCI.  HICE or their designee shall maintain the annual\ninventory of accountable SCI.   \n(1) All DoD Components will honor the designation of accountable SCI.\n(2) An annual report of accountable authorizations, volume, and cost may be required at\nthe request of the DNI. \n(3) Accountability records are not required for non-accountable SCI.  Intelligence\ninformation that has not yet been converted into finished intelligence is considered non-\naccountable SCI.   \n(a) Records for Incoming Accountable SCI.  A record shall be kept of accountable\nSCI and shall identify the material by document accountability number and copy number, \noriginator, and a brief description of the material and storage location.  Keeping copies of \nreceipts or maintaining other records that provide required identifying data satisfy this \nrequirement.  For electronic records, retention of standard telecommunications center records \nfulfill this requirement.  Internal receipting or administrative controls within the same SCIF is \nnot required. \n(b) Records for Outgoing Accountable SCI.  A receipt is required for accountable\nSCI.  Receipts shall identify the material by accountability number, copy number, and originator, \ncontain a brief unclassified description of the material and identify the recipient.  The required \nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 4 \n30 \nDCD pouch or package receipt kept by the sender is sufficient to fulfill this requirement.  The \noriginator is responsible for preparing receipts for SCI material. \n(c) Records Retention.  For accountable SCI (e.g., SAP material), retain records of\nincoming and outgoing accountable SCI (such as receipts and document control logs) and \ncertificates of destruction as permanent records (see paragraph 19.b. of this Enclosure).  For non-\naccountable SCI, transmission receipts may be destroyed on acknowledgment of successful \ntransmission to the intended recipient. \n12. SCI DOCUMENT ACCOUNTABILITY NUMBER\na. Assign an accountability number to accountable SCI material only.  Accountability\nnumbers are not required for SCI documents unless explicitly required by program specific \nguidance.     \nb. Assign copy numbers to individual documents.  Place the copy number next to or near the\ncontrol number at the lower right corner of the document.  Show reproduced copies with a \ncombination of digits and letters (e.g., Copy 1A, Copy 4C) or identify the copy as Series B, \nSeries C, etc.   \nc. The HICE or designee may designate special control numbers for contractor-originated\nSCI. \n13. STORAGE.  SCI material shall be maintained and stored in an accredited SCIF.\na. Combinations and codes to access control devices should be given to a limited number of\nSCI-indoctrinated personnel consistent with effective SCIF operations.  Combinations to locks \ninstalled on security containers, perimeter doors, and any other openings must be changed: \n(1) When a combination is first installed or used.\n(2) When a combination has been compromised, or believed to have been compromised.\n(3) At other times when considered necessary by the SSO.\n(4) When taken out of service; combination locks shall be reset to the standard\ncombination 50-25-50. \nb. Codes to access control devices (cipher, electronic, etc.) shall be provided only to SCI\nindoctrinated personnel.     \nc. When practical, SCI material should be segregated from other material in a separate file\ncabinet, drawer, or folder.  Security regulations or directives governing collateral files do not \napply to SCI material. \nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 4 \n31 \nd. U.S. collateral classified information used in a SCIF shall be stored in accordance with the\nSCIF accreditation and managed in accordance with the guidance in Reference (k). \n14. TEMPORARY RELEASE OUTSIDE OF A SCIF.  In Government facilities, when\noperational needs require the release of SCI for temporary use by SCI-indoctrinated persons in\nnon-SCI accredited areas, only the CSA, their designee, or the Component SIO may grant such\nrelease.  In a combat zone, the force commander or local SIO may authorize temporary release\nunder emergency conditions.  The SCI security official shall obtain a signed receipt for SCI\nreleased in this manner and ensure that conditions of use of the released material provide\nadequate security to include acoustic and visual protection until the SCI is returned to a SCIF by\nthe end of the duty day.  SCI material shall not be left with non-SCI-indoctrinated personnel.\nThis does not preclude transporting of properly wrapped SCI by DCD or U.S. Diplomatic\nCourier Service personnel.  If temporary release is needed for more than one or two occasions,\nconsideration should be given to establishing a permanent SCIF.  This temporary release\nauthority is not intended to remove the requirement to use a properly accredited SCIF in day to\nday situations.\n15. REPRODUCTION.  Reproduction of SCI documents shall be kept to a minimum consistent\nwith operational necessity.  Within a SCIF, reproduction equipment must display the\nclassification levels and SCI authorized for reproduction by each piece of reproduction\nequipment.\na. Stated prohibitions or limitations against reproduction shall be honored.  The originator is\nthe approval authority for reproduction in such cases.  \nb. Copies of documents are subject to the same control, accountability, and destruction\nprocedures as the original documents.  Extracts of documents shall be marked according to \ncontent and treated as working materials.   \nc. Equipment connected to remote diagnostic centers, such as by telephone lines, are\nprohibited for SCI reproduction unless the capability has been disabled. \n16. TRANSPORTATION OF SCI INFORMATION\na. General Provisions.  Alternately, SCI shall be transferred by SCI indoctrinated persons,\ncertified or designated couriers, diplomatic pouch, or DCD.  The SSO or SCI Security Official \nshall establish strict accountability and control for courier cards.   \n(1) The preferred method of transporting SCI from one SCIF to another shall be via\nsecure e-mail or other secure electronic means.  Alternatively, SCI shall be transported by SCI-\nindoctrinated persons, certified or designated couriers, diplomatic pouch, or DCD.  See section \n17 of this enclosure for specific wrapping instructions. \nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 4 \n32 \n(2) When transporting SCI within a single building (military headquarters or DoD-\ncontrolled building), SCI material shall be placed in a locked brief case or locked pouch made of \ncanvas or other heavy-duty material and must have an integral key-operated lock.  The briefcase \nor pouch shall bear a subtle notice indicating that anyone finding the container unattended must \nnotify the owner immediately and to arrange to return it unopened to the owner.  Formal \ndesignation or identification of a courier is not required. \n(3) When transporting SCI between SCIFs in two different locations (different buildings\nor different bases), in addition to the requirement in subparagraph 17.a.(1) of this enclosure, an \ninventory of the contents shall be left in the departure SCIF until proof that the SCI has arrived at \nthe destination.  Formal designation or identification of a courier is required. \n(4) Couriers traveling aboard U.S.-flag commercial aircraft must also have a separate\nsigned original letter of authorization as shown in Appendix 1 to this enclosure, and as required \nby the Transportation Security Administration and Federal Aviation Administration.  Coordinate \nwith airport security officials prior to travel whenever possible. \n(5) Couriers must have a DD Form 2501, \u201cCourier Authorization,\u201d or equivalent with the\nacronym \u201cSCI\u201d displayed prominently on one portion of the card.  \nb. Courier Authorizations\n(1) If electronic transmittal of SCI is not possible, and hand-carrying SCI will occur\nwithin the United States, SSOs shall appoint couriers in writing.  SSOs may approve hand-\ncarrying of SCI aboard U.S.-flag commercial passenger aircraft for travel within the United \nStates. \n(2) For travel outside the United States, the local SIO shall appoint SCI couriers in\nwriting.  SIOs may delegate this authority to SSOs, except for couriering on foreign-flag aircraft. \n(3) Air Courier Orders are not required for transport of SCI material via military aircraft\n(such as the Air Mobility Command).  \n(4) SCI couriers may transport collateral classified material without a separate\ndesignation as a collateral courier. \n(5) The appointing authority shall maintain a current list of all designated couriers.\n(6) Travel orders will not indicate that the individual is an SCI courier, but may show\n\u201cOfficial Courier.\u201d  Instructions applicable to the local situation may be added. \n(7) The SSO or SCI security official shall establish strict accountability and control for\ncourier cards. \nc. Courier Requirements.  Couriers shall be an active duty military person, including\nreservists on active duty for training and Federalized National Guardsmen; a U.S. Government \nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 4 \n33 \ncivilian employee; or a DoD contractor (when authorized by DD 254 or consultant (when \nauthorized by statement of work order).  Couriers shall be specifically designated as a courier, \nand have authorized access to the SCI material they are transporting.  They must be familiar with \nall rules and regulations governing couriers and transporting information, including hand-\ncarrying aboard military, U.S. Government chartered, or commercial aircraft.  SCI material shall \nbe properly wrapped prior to giving the material to a courier except when paragraph 17.a.(2) \napplies. \n(1) Certified couriers are individuals whose primary responsibility is to courier SCI\nmaterial worldwide.  \n(2) Designated couriers are individuals whose temporary responsibility is to courier SCI\nmaterial. \n(3) Prior to receiving a courier card, each courier shall read the appropriate extracts from\nthe espionage laws and execute a certificate acknowledging receipt of the courier card.  See \nAppendix 2 of this Enclosure for the certificate format. \nd. Courier Procedures.  The local SIO shall establish courier procedures for organizations\nunder their security cognizance.  The procedures will reflect the policies and procedures of this \nVolume, will designate local travel areas; will ensure SCI materials are handled only by SCI \nindoctrinated individuals; will ensure the materials are protected against the possibility of \nhijacking, loss, exposure to unauthorized persons, or other forms of compromise; and will ensure \ncourier procedures comply with Transportation Security Administration policy. \n(1) General.  One person may serve as a courier; however, the courier authority shall\nassess the circumstances such as volume of material, means of travel, high crime area, or \nsensitivity level and determine if more than one person is required to maintain continuous \ncustody of the material.  DIA recommends using two SCI-indoctrinated personnel couriers \nbeyond the local travel area because of the possibility of emergency situations.   \n(a) The SCI storage provisions of this Manual apply at all stops en route to the\ndestination, unless the SCI is retained in the personal possession of the courier, and under \nconstant surveillance at all times. \n(b) Hand-carrying SCI on trips that involve an overnight stop is not permissible\nwithout advance arrangements for secure overnight storage of the SCI in a U.S. Government \nfacility which is accredited to store SCI.  Within the United States, a cleared contractor facility \nthat has the requisite storage capability may be used. \n(c) SCI shall not be read, studied, displayed, discussed, or used in any manner in\npublic conveyances or places. \n(d) SCI shall not be hand-carried across international borders unless the home station\nactivity issuing the written authorization is relatively certain that the SCI will not be opened by \nforeign customs, border, postal or other inspectors, either U.S. or foreign. \nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 4 \n34 \n(e) Envelopes containing SCI shall not be used to carry or convey personal items,\ncommunications, or other similar objects. \n(f) Round trip hand-carrying of SCI is the exception rather than the rule.  If the SCI\nis to be returned to the home station, it should be transmitted back from the travel destination by \nsecure means. \n(2) Ground Transportation.  See Appendix 3 to this Enclosure for specific instructions.\n(3) Air Travel.\n(a) Authorization to hand-carry SCI on a plane may be granted only in exceptional\nsituations and when:  \n1. The material is needed urgently for a specified official purpose; and\n2. There is a specified reason that the material could not be transmitted by other\napproved means in enough time for the stated purpose. \n(b) Couriers shall possess an original letter of authorization for commercial air (see\nAppendix 1 to this Enclosure), shall receive written special instructions (see Appendix 3 to this \nEnclosure), and shall sign a statement acknowledging understanding and acceptance of courier \nresponsibilities. \n(c) Recurring or blanket courier letters of authorization for commercial air will not be\nissued. \n(d) Couriers shall use foreign carriers only when no U.S.-flag carrier is available.\nThe approving official must ensure that the SCI will remain in the custody and physical control \nof the U.S. courier at all times.  Authorization will be granted on a case-by-case basis and only \nwhen all efforts to transmit by other means is not possible.   \n(e) Envelopes containing SCI are to be free of metal binders, clips, or other metallic\nobjects that might trigger air terminal screening devices.  If the envelopes are in a briefcase or \ncarry-on-luggage, the briefcase or luggage may be opened for inspection.  The screening officials \nmay check envelopes by x-ray machine, flexing, feeling, and weighing. \n(f) Shipping SCI in cartons or containers too large to hand-carry aboard commercial\npassenger aircraft is highly discouraged.  If the SCI cannot be kept in the possession of the \ncourier at all times, it should be shipped via DCD.   \n(g) If the transport of cargo is approved aboard military, U.S. chartered aircraft, or\ncommercial airlines, the actual loading and unloading of the SCI will be under the supervision of \na representative of the air carrier.  The appointed courier shall accompany the classified cargo \nand keep it under surveillance during loading and unloading operations.  In addition, \nappropriately cleared personnel (to include the courier) must be available to conduct surveillance \nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 4 \n35 \nat any intermediate stops where the cargo compartment is opened.  These arrangements require \nprior coordination with the airlines and the Transportation Security Administration. \n(4) Issuing Courier Letters to Non-Assigned Personnel.  Local SCI security officials may\nissue courier letters of authorization to non-assigned personnel to hand-carry SCI when: \n(a) The local SCI security official verifies the individual and the receiving facility\nhas the appropriate clearance and access level.  The verification may be made by the personnel \nsecurity system of record or telephone. \n(b) The parent or supporting SCI security office confirms the requirement for the\nindividual to courier the material.  The confirmation may be made by telephone. \n(c) The local SCI security official packages the material and prepares the proper\nreceipts and inventory list. \n17. SCI WRAPPING REQUIREMENTS\na. SCI requires double-wrapping using two opaque envelopes, Kraft wrapping paper, or\ncanvas bags, cartons, leather or plastic pouches, or similar containers which preclude observation \nof the contents.  Seal all seams of both wrappers with reinforced paper tape or utilize tamper-\nevident tape or tamper-evident containers/bags.  Do not use masking or cellophane tape.  Retain \nan inventory of the material until verification is received that the information was delivered to an \nauthorized recipient.  Prepare packages for distribution as described in this section.  If project or \ncontrol officer material requires special procedures, follow the project office guidelines.     \n(1) Inner Wrapper\n(a) Place the address of the receiving SCIF in the center of the package; place the\naddress of the sending SCIF in the upper left corner. \n(b) Include originator package control number if applicable (lower right corner is\nrecommended). \n(c) Stamp or print in large letters above the address of the receiving SCIF:  \u201cTO BE\nOPENED ONLY BY (SCI security official, e.g., SSO, GAMMA control officer, TCO, HCO, or \nappropriately cleared recipient).\u201d \n(d) Stamp or print in large letters at the top and bottom on each side, the appropriate\nsecurity classification and SCI compartments. \n(e) Stamp or print the statement:  \u201cCONTAINS SENSITIVE COMPARTMENTED\nINFORMATION\u201d on each side. \n(2) Outer Wrapper\nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 4 \n36 \n(a) Place the address of the receiving SCIF in the center of the package; place the\naddress of the sending SCIF in the upper left corner. \n(b) Include the originator package control number, if used (lower right corner is\nrecommended). \n(c) Secure outer containers with tape, lead seals, tumbler padlocks, or other means\nwhich reasonably protect against surreptitious access. \n(d) DCD packages have special outer-wrapper instructions.  Refer to the U.S.\nTransportation Command Website (http://www.transcom.mil/dcd) for detailed instructions. \nb. SCI shall be transported from one SCIF to another in a manner that properly protects the\nSCI material.  For local travel, SCI material may be hand-carried using a locked pouch as the \nouter wrapper along with an inner wrapper.  Attach an unobtrusive luggage tag with the \nfollowing notation to the pouch: \u201cPROPERTY OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TO BE \nRETURNED UNOPENED TO (name of the appropriate organization and telephone number that \nwill be manned at all times).\u201d \nc. Special Wrapping Requirements\n(1) If the classified portion of an SCI project is an internal component of a piece of\nequipment or other bulky item whose outside shell is not classified and completely shields the \nclassified aspects of the item from view, the shell may serve as the outer covering. \n(2) If the classified portion of the SCI material is an item of equipment that cannot easily\nbe put into a packaged and the shell or body is classified or sight-sensitive, drape the equipment \nwith an opaque covering that will conceal all classified or sight-sensitive features.  Coverings \nmust be secured to prevent accidental exposure of the item. \n(3) Specialized shipping containers, including closed cargo transporters, may be used in\nlieu of the package requirements described in paragraph 17.a. of this enclosure and may serve as \nthe outer wrapping. \n(4) Packaging material shall be strong enough to provide protection while in transit and\nto prevent damage or compromise of classified material or information.  Use seals, Kraft paper, \nreinforced tapes, puncture resistant material, wire mesh or other knife-slashing resistant material \nto prevent items from breaking out and to facilitate the detection of tampering.  The inner \ncontents, labels, tags, etc., shall not be visible. \n18. DISPOSITION\na. Contractors shall return all classified material received or generated in the performance of\na classified contract unless the material has been approved for destruction by the Government, or \nthe DD Form 254 or other official document(s) authorizes retention.   \nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 4 \n37 \nb. SCI shall be retained for the time periods specified in records control schedules approved\nby the archivist of the United States in accordance with section 3302 of title 44, U.S.C. \n(Reference (aa)).  Destroy duplicate and non-record copies of SCI documents as soon as their \npurpose has been served. \n19. DESTRUCTION\na. Destroy SCI in a manner that will prevent reconstruction.  Only those DNI approved\nmethods (e.g., burning, pulping, shredding, pulverizing, melting, or chemical decomposition, \ndepending on the type of materials to be destroyed) specifically authorized by the responsible \nSIO may be used.  SCI indoctrinated person(s) will conduct the destruction.  The SIO or \ndesignee may determine that two persons are appropriate when high volume or bulk destruction \nof accountable data or when the destruction of accountable data is external to a SCIF.  SCI in \ncomputer, AIS, or other computer storage media will be destroyed as specified in NSA/CSS \npolicy. \nb. Destruction certificates are required for accountable SCI.  If an organization maintains a\nmaster record of accountable SCI and destruction is recorded in the master record, individual \ndestruction certificates may be destroyed after recording in the master record.  Multimedia copies \nof accountable records are authorized provided all information is readable and hardcopy prints \ncan be made to meet investigative or judicial requirements.   \nc. SCI in computer or AIS or other magnetic media shall be destroyed as specified in the\n\u201cGuide to Understanding Data Remanence in Automated Information Systems\u201d (Reference (ab)), \nor as authorized by NSA in other publications. \nd. If burn bags are used to hold SCI waste, mark the bag when placed in use with the highest\nsecurity classification of the material it might contain, the phrase \u201cCONTAINS SCI \nMATERIAL,\u201d and the office symbol and phone number of the SCIF.  When filled, seal the bag \nwith staples or tape to prevent accidental tearing or breaking.  In SCIFs not accredited for open \nstorage, SCI waste must be secured in approved GSA security containers. \n20. EMERGENCY PLANS.  Plans shall be developed to protect, remove, or destroy classified\nmaterial in case of fire, natural disaster, civil disturbance, terrorist activities, or enemy action to\nminimize the risk of compromise, and for the recovery of classified information, if necessary,\nfollowing such events.  The level of detail and the amount of testing and rehearsal of these plans\nshall be determined by assessing the risk of hostile action, foreign intelligence threats, natural\ndisaster, or terrorist activity that may place the information in jeopardy.\na. Use the requirements of Committee on National Security Systems Instruction 4004.1\n(Reference (ac)) when developing plans for the emergency protection (including emergency \ndestruction under no-notice conditions) of classified COMSEC material.  \nb. When preparing emergency plans, consider:\nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 4 \n38 \n(1) Reducing the amount of classified material on hand.\n(2) Storing less frequently used classified material at other secure locations.\n(3) Creating regular backup copies of information in electronic formats for off-site\nstorage.  \n(4) Transferring as much retained classified information to removable electronic media\nas possible, thereby reducing its bulk. \nAppendixes \n1.

SCI courier certification should be signed by the courier and witnessed and signed by the\nsecurity official issuing the courier order.  A copy of this certification shall be maintained by the\nlocal security officer and destroyed 1 year after the expiration of the courier authorization.\nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nAPPENDIX 3 TO ENCLOSURE 4 \n41 \nAPPENDIX 3 TO ENCLOSURE 4 \nSPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ONE-TIME COURIERS OF SCI OUTSIDE THE LOCAL \nTRAVEL AREA \n1. SCI couriers are responsible for the protection of the material in their custody.  Couriers must\navoid all places, situations, and circumstances that could compromise their ability to protect the\nclassified material.  Couriers have discharged their responsibilities once they have released the\nmaterial to the authorized recipient in the SSO at their destination.\n2. All SCI materials shall be double-wrapped.  A locked briefcase or pouch should serve as the\nouter wrapper.  Attach a courier tag to the outer envelope of each parcel containing classified\ninformation.  Do not attach a courier tag to the outside of a briefcase, attach\u00e9 case, etc., or to a\ncarton or container being escorted, as this would draw attention to the classified material.  The\ninner wrappers must be marked or labeled as indicated in Figure 2:\nFigure 2.  Marking Inner Wrappers of Classified Material. \n3. Opaque envelopes or wrapping paper, or tamper-evident packaging shall be used for the inner\nwrappers; all seams are to be taped with reinforced paper/plastic tape or tamper-evident tape.\nBulky material may be packaged in durable fiberboard, cardboard, or wooden boxes.  Place\nproper security classification and SCI caveats on both sides of the innermost wrapper.  A list of\nall SCI material being transported must be left at the originating facility with the office of the\ncourier.  SCI documents will not be left with or signed over to another individual other than the\nspecific addressee or the SSO.\n4. SCI material shall remain in the courier\u2019s personal possession and under their constant\nsurveillance at all times.  The SCI must be stored in properly accredited SCIFs at all stops en\nroute to the final destination.  Do not leave SCI material in locked automobiles, quarters, hotel\nrooms, train compartments, etc., or stored in automobile trunks or in any detachable storage\ncompartment.  If intermittent stops are made between the origin of flight and final destination,\nthe courier will witness the opening and closing of the storage compartment at each stop to make\nsure that the material is not tampered with or erroneously off loaded.  To maintain custody of the\nmaterial at an en route stop, the courier may place the material in the temporary custody of the\nlocal DCD station commander.\nIF FOUND, DO NOT OPEN.  IMMEDIATELY \nNOTIFY: \nSSO (name of organization and mailing address) \nTelephone:  \nDefense Switched Network:   \nAfter Duty Hours Telephone:  \nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nAPPENDIX 3 TO ENCLOSURE 4 \n42 \n5. The shipping of SCI in cartons and containers that are too large to hand-carry aboard\ncommercial passenger aircraft and must be placed in the aircraft\u2019s sealed cargo compartment is\nhighly discouraged.  If the SCI cannot be kept in the possession of the courier at all times, then it\nshould be shipped via DCD on military air.  If the transport is approved, the SSO who has\nauthorized the transport of the SCI will notify the appropriate air carrier in advance.  The courier\nwill report to the affected airline ticket counter before boarding, present his/her documentation,\nand the package or cartons to be exempt from screening.  The airline representative will review\nthe documentation and description of the containers to be exempt.  If satisfied with the\nidentification of the courier and his documentation, the official will provide the passenger with\nan escort to the screening station and authorize the screening personnel to exempt the container\nfrom physical or other type inspection.  The actual loading and unloading of the SCI will be\nunder the supervision of a representative of the air carrier; however, appropriately cleared\npersonnel will accompany the classified information and keep it under surveillance during\nloading and unloading operations.  In addition, appropriately cleared personnel (to include the\ncourier) must be available to conduct surveillance at any intermediate stops where the cargo\ncompartment is to be opened.  If the airline official is not satisfied with the identification of the\npassenger or the authenticity of his documentation, the courier will not be permitted to board,\nand not be subject to further screening for boarding purposes.  These types of arrangements\nrequire prior coordination with the airlines.\n6. SCI hand-carried aboard commercial passenger airlines must be accomplished only aboard a\nU.S. carrier.  Foreign carriers will be used only when no U.S. carrier is available.  If a foreign\ncarrier is used, the information must remain in the custody and physical control of the U.S.\ncourier at all times.\n7. Couriers shall use the most direct route feasible.  If a courier is unable to follow the itinerary\nor if the material is lost, stolen, or otherwise subjected to compromise en route, the courier will\nimmediately report the circumstances to the parent SSO.  Hand-carrying SCI on trips that\ninvolve an overnight stop is not permissible without advance arrangements for secure overnight\nstorage in a U.S. Government facility that is accredited to store SCI.  Within the United States, a\ncleared contractor SCIF that has the requisite storage capability may be used.  If an overnight\nstop or unforeseen delay is encountered while en route and an accredited facility is not available,\nthe material may be stored at a DCD courier transfer station (CTS), if available.  If a CTS is used\nfor overnight storage, a signed receipt will be obtained.  If none of these facilities is available,\nthe courier must retain the material in their personal possession and properly safeguard it during\nthe period of delay.\n8. SCI will not be read, studied, displayed, discussed, or used in any manner in public\nconveyances or places.  Do not discuss SCI except in secure areas officially approved for such\ndiscussion.  All personnel having access to or viewing the material must be authorized the\nappropriate level of SCI access.\n9. SCI documents must be returned to SSO control as soon as possible.  Local couriers must\nreturn material to SSO control prior to the close of business on the day of receipt unless prior\narrangements are made.  Couriers will verify each item by the package, pouch, or, in the case of\nindividual documents, control number when receipting for or delivering material.  SCI material\nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nAPPENDIX 3 TO ENCLOSURE 4 \n43 \nwill be delivered only to the specific addressees designated by the dispatching unit.  Positive \nidentification will be obtained before release of the material.  Couriers will neither reproduce nor \npermit reproduction of SCI material without prior approval of (organization SSO). \n10. SCI shall not be hand-carried across international borders unless the home station activity\nissuing the written authorization is reasonably certain that the SCI will not be opened by foreign\ncustoms, border, postal or other inspectors, either U.S. or foreign.\n11. Envelopes containing SCI should not be used to carry or convey personal items,\ncommunications, or other similar objects.\n12. Round trip hand-carrying of SCI is the exception rather than the rule.  If the SCI is to be\nreturned to the home station, it should be transmitted back from the travel destination by secure\nmeans.\n13. SCI material shall be stored with a servicing SSO at the TDY location and provided to that\nSSO for wrapping, controlling and shipping by DCD to (home station).  If material must be\ntransported round-trip, the SSO at the TDY location will wrap and control material before\nremanding to the courier\u2019s custody.\n14. Federal Aviation Regulations require that all passengers and their carry-on items be screened\nbefore boarding military or commercial aircraft.  Couriers of SCI should routinely offer\nbriefcases or pouches for inspection.  The courier letter or order may be offered, if requested.\nThe contents of briefcases and pouches may be allowed to go through metal detection devices\nunopened.  In the event that the person conducting the screening is not satisfied, and there is\ndoubt as to the contents of the envelopes, the courier will not be permitted to board with the\nbriefcases or pouches.  Never allow screening personnel to open envelopes containing classified\nmaterial.  Envelopes containing SCI must be free of metal binders, clips, or other metallic objects\nthat might trigger air terminal screening devices.  If the envelopes are contained in a briefcase or\ncarry-on-luggage, the briefcase or luggage may be opened for inspection for weapons or\ncontraband.  The screening officials may check envelopes by x-ray machine, flexing, feel, and\nweight.  In the event that the courier is not allowed to board the aircraft, they shall contact the\nauthorizing SSO for instructions.\n15. The courier appointment does not authorize the bearer to carry SCI material to their home or\noffice for personal convenience.  Recurring or blanket courier letters for commercial air are not\nauthorized.  Local SCI security officials shall not grant authority to non-assigned personnel to\nhand-carry SCI without prior permission of their parent agency, organization, service, or unit.\n16. Noncompliance with the foregoing may be grounds for disciplinary action.\nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 5 \n44 \nENCLOSURE 5 \nTRANSMISSION SECURITY \n1. ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION OF SCI.  Senders transmitting SCI electronically\n(including facsimile, computer, secure voice, e-mail, or any other means of telecommunication)\nmust ensure that such transmissions are made only to authorized recipients.  Recipients will\nprovide proper protection for SCI received.  Electronic transmission of SCI is limited to\nspecifically designated and accredited communications circuits secured by an NSA-approved\ncryptographic system or a protected distribution system accredited in accordance with Enclosure\n4 of Volume 2.\na. SCI, regardless of its classification, shall not be processed on, transferred to, or stored on\nSIPRNET-connected or unclassified information systems. \nb. Any transfer to and/or processing or storage of SCI on SIPRNET or an unclassified\nsystem constitutes an unauthorized disclosure and must be reported in accordance with those \nprocedures.  The SSO shall contact and work with the information assurance staff to ensure \nappropriate and timely resolution of the incident.   \n2. SECURITY RESPONSIBILITIES.  The local SSO is responsible for ensuring that supporting\ncommunications centers establish and implement appropriate security and control procedures to\nprotect the categories of SCI and that all personnel are familiar with these procedures.\nIndividuals are responsible for ensuring that message addressees are authorized to receive the\ncategory of SCI or multiple control system information to be transmitted.  Any variation from the\nprescribed security standards for transmission of SCI by electrical means will be referred to SSO\nDIA/DAC.\n3. COMSEC TRAINING PROGRAMS.  Only properly trained individuals are authorized to\noperate cryptographic equipment.  The DoD Components will ensure that personnel in\ncryptographic operations, maintenance, and other COMSEC specialties receive the required\ntraining to perform their duties.\n4. GUIDELINES.  The following is the minimum criteria for an electrical circuit transmitting\nSCI:\na. A circuit (not including an NSA-sponsored circuit) between two or more SCI facilities,\nexcept for Protected Distribution Systems (PDSs), must be validated by DIA  in accordance with \nDepartment of the Interior Acquisition Regulation 35-2 (Reference (ad)).  Retain the circuit \nvalidation documentation within the SCIF for which it was validated. \nb. SCIFs must be accredited to the same level of SCI transmitted or received on electrical\ncircuits entering or exiting the SCIF.  The construction and protection of SCI \nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 5 \n45 \ntelecommunications facilities will be in accordance with Reference (t) and NACSI 4000-series or \nsuccessor publications. \nc. Personnel having access to the SCI unencrypted data on the circuit or personnel\nresponsible for SCI encryption equipment  must be SCI-indoctrinated to the appropriate level to \nminimize risk while still only granting access to sensitive programs when appropriate. \nd. All equipment and associated transmission lines at each end of the circuit handling plain\ntext (unencrypted) SCI must be installed in accredited SCI facilities.  (The term \u201cequipment\u201d as \nused in this paragraph refers to all electrical and electromechanical devices used to handle plain \ntext information, including but not limited to end-terminal equipment, patches, interface units, \nautomated switches, multiplexers, and computer systems.) \ne. COMSEC equipment and cryptographic systems must be NSA-approved for the highest\nlevel of classification of the traffic transmitted on the system. \nf. All equipment, including COMSEC, and associated unencrypted transmission lines must\nbe installed in accordance with Reference (m). \ng. All equipment and PDSs must be accredited in accordance with Enclosure 4 of Volume 2.\n5. COLLATERAL CIRCUITS WITHIN SCI AREAS.  Communications, command and control,\nor intelligence data circuits that are not approved for the transmission of SCI will not be installed\nwithin a SCIF without the consent of the SCIF IA approval authority in accordance with section\n6 of this enclosure.  Additionally, such systems must be installed in a manner that preserves the\ncommunications and physical security integrity of collocated SCI systems and circuits and meets\nTEMPEST requirements.\n6. APPROVAL AUTHORITY\na. The HICEs of the Military Departments and Command Level SIOs or CSAs, following\nthe guidelines in section 4 of this enclosure, may authorize installation of collateral circuits in \nSCI facilities under their security cognizance.  DAC shall be notified of all collateral circuits \ninstalled in SCIFs. \nb. The HICEs of the Military Departments and Command Level SIOs and CSAs may grant\ntemporary approval to transmit SCI over a circuit or protected distribution system.  This approval \nshall be documented in writing with a signature.  DIA may further delegate temporary approval \nauthority for DoD Field Activities.  Prior to granting interim approval, the approving authority \nmust assess the risk and measures taken to manage the risk.  Temporary approval shall not \nexceed 30 days; operational restrictions will be imposed as required.  All circuits containing \nresidual SCI (e.g., hard drives, routers, key material) must be properly secured in an accredited \nSCIF or continuously protected by SCI personnel when not in use.  Commanders will notify \nDAC of interim approvals. \nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 5 \n46 \n7. MULTI-FUNCTION OFFICE MACHINES (M-FOMs).  M-FOMs are devices that have the\ncapability to copy, print, scan, and fax, either in a standalone or networked mode.  When\nconnected to a network, M-FOM devices assume the highest classification for which the network\nis accredited.  If operated as a standalone or multi-function device, these devices assume the\nhighest classification of copied documents.  Many M-FOM hard drives are capable of holding\nthousands of images depending on the size and complexity of the images.  The SSO shall\nestablish written procedures to protect the information contained within the hard drive and\nprinted circuit boards/memory boards of the M-FOM.\na. All external data connections must be disabled when M-FOMs are used to process (i.e.,\nscan, copy, print, or fax) classified information.  Some M-FOMs have the capability to allow the \nvendor to receive copies of documents (i.e., 1 of every 100), through hardware or wireless \ntransmission mediums, whether scanned, printed, copied or faxed, to maintain quality control of \nthe M-FOM; these features must be disconnected or disabled. \nb. To prevent the inadvertent or deliberate downloading of classified information, service\ntechnicians shall not connect a proprietary laptop to an M-FOM that processes classified \ninformation.  Laptops required for diagnostics must be purchased by the command or agency \n(software included) and maintained by the SSO in the SCIF.  The hard drive, printed circuit \nboards or memory boards, and like memory storage devices, cannot be removed from the SCIF \nto a non-SCIF area unless the device is properly sanitized of all classified or sensitive \ninformation.  The classified information stored on the hard drive is the property of the United \nStates and must not be released outside official channels.  For this reason, all M-FOM hard \ndrives and printed circuit boards or memory boards (Government or lease) must be removed \nprior to their final disposition. \nc. Purchased M-FOMs are Government property.  Turning them into the Defense\nReutilization Management Office without a hard drive is acceptable, provided all printed circuit \nboards or memory boards are removed.  Leased M-FOMs may need to be returned in working \norder at the conclusion of the lease.  In this instance, a second hard drive should be purchased.  \nThe built-in internal hard drive may be extremely difficult to access and remove, requiring \ndisassembly.  For this reason, leasing the M-FOM with a removable hard drive vice an internal \nfixed hard drive is recommended.  Printed circuit cards or memory boards will be removed prior \nto returning the M-FOM to the vendor.   \nd. Removal or return of purely mechanical or electro-mechanical parts to a vendor will only\nbe permitted based on a risk determination that includes consideration of threat, vulnerability, \nimpact, and cost.  Printed circuit boards or memory boards are to be destroyed as classified trash \nat the classification level as determined in this enclosure.  No parts will be released outside the \nUnited States or in areas with a high foreign intelligence or terrorist threat. \ne. All communications ports not specifically required for networked or contractual\nmaintenance must be removed or permanently disabled.  Only hardwired connections are \npermitted.  IR, RF, video, or audio communications are prohibited.  This provision must be \nincluded in the purchase contract. \nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 5 \n47 \n8. SECURE TELEPHONE DEVICES\na. In accordance with DoDI 8560.01 (Reference (ae)), all telephones subject to COMSEC\nmonitoring will display DD Form 2056, \u201cTelephone Monitoring Notification Decal.\u201d  \nb. The Crypto-Ignition Key for a Secure Telephone Unit (STU) III telephone or a Fortezza\nCard/KOV-14 for a Secure Terminal Equipment (STE) telephone located in SCIFs is configured \nby the NSA Electronic Key Management System Central Facility.  Secure telephones configured \nwith a TOP SECRET SCI key shall not be used in non-SCI accredited areas. \nc. Telephones configured with a residential or mobile key can provide a limited capability\nfor senior leaders and decision makers to receive secure calls.  In these instances, security \nprocedures covered in NSTISSI 3030 (Reference (af)) (for STE telephones) and NSTISSI 3013 \n(Reference (ag)) (for STU telephones) apply.  Specific questions can be addressed to the \nsupporting COMSEC officer or the National Security Agency, Information Assurance Policy, \nProcedures, and Insecurities Division (I41), (410) 854-6831. \nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 6 \n48 \nENCLOSURE 6 \nIS SECURITY \n1. GENERAL.  Reference (v) establishes the security policy and procedures for storing,\nprocessing, and communicating classified intelligence information in IC.  The IC seeks\nstandardization of IS security policy and procedures.  The physical, personnel, and information\nsecurity practices and procedures described in this Manual must accommodate a wide range of\ninformation system security concepts and requirements.  Information system security and the\nachievement of information assurance are linked with and dependent upon all other security\ndisciplines.\na. All DoD Intelligence Information Systems (DoDIIS) must be certified and accredited in\naccordance with References (u), (v), and this Manual.  Joint Air Force-Army-Navy (JAFANs) \nregulations for SAP may also pertain to certain IS.   \nb. Unclassified or collateral (non-SCI) networked IS collocated in DIA SCIFs will be\nconsidered guest systems and their currently approved accreditation accepted.  SCI security \npersonnel will ensure IS security policies are in place to provide a continued safe SCIF IS \noperating environment and establish a mechanism for the SCI IA approval authority for these \nactions.  SSOs and security personnel should reference other guidance as required such as DoDD \n8500.01E (Reference (ah)), and DoDIs 8500.2 DoDIs 8500.01 and 8510.01 (References (ah) and \n(ai) and (aj)).   \nc. All DoD IS must maintain an appropriate level of integrity, authentication, non-\nrepudiation, availability, and confidentiality. \nd. As the information system conditions and features are designed and implemented, it is\nimportant to consider: \n(1) The importance and sensitivity of the information and information assets.\n(2) Documented threats and vulnerabilities.\n(3) The trustworthiness of users and interconnecting systems.\n(4) The impact of impairment or destruction to the DoD information system.\n(5) Cost effectiveness of security features or selected countermeasures.\ne. Every DoDIIS must be accredited, either as a separately accredited system, or as part of an\naccredited DoDIIS site.  Operation of stand-alone IS systems within SCIFs will be approved and \naccredited by the SIO.   \nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \nENCLOSURE 6 \n49 \n2. SSO RESPONSIBILITIES.  An SSO is responsible for all resident SCI information,\nincluding that which exists on IS within a SCIF.  The SSO must coordinate IS security with the\nIAM.  The IAM develops and maintains an accreditation/certification support documentation\npackage for system(s) for which they are responsible.  Both the SSO and the IAM shall maintain\ncontrol of any IS, regardless of classification level or sensitivity, introduced into a SCIF so that it\nis operated, maintained, and disposed of in accordance with internal security policies and\nprocedures as outlined in the accreditation/certification support documentation package.\n3. CABLE INSTALLATION.  Any area supporting SCI processing shall be accredited by DIA\nand safeguarded as a SCIF prior to installation.  All IT cabling and infrastructure that supports\nsecure communications will be stored in a secured area until used or decommissioned.  Cabling\nand cable connectors shall be color coded to distinguish their classification level.  If color coding\nis not possible, cabling shall be clearly marked to denote their classification level. All cabling\nshall enter a SCIF from a single location and must be identified and labeled with its purpose and\ndestination at the point of entry.  All cabling installations must be installed in accordance with\nTEMPEST requirements spelled out by a DIA-Certified TEMPEST Technical Authority.  All\nexcess old cabling that is no longer needed shall be removed.  DIA installation personnel must be\nU.S. citizens who have been subjected to a favorable NCIC and NAC check.  Installation\npersonnel without the proper clearance shall be escorted by cleared personnel.  Cleared IT\nprofessionals or Construction Surveillance Technicians (CSTs) shall be used to monitor the\ninstallation of cabling and infrastructure supporting JWICS networks.  The number of escorts\nand CSTs shall be specified in the Construction Security Plan (CSP).\nDoDM 5105.21-V1, October 19, 2012 \nChange 1, 05/16/2018  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGLOSSARY \n50 \nGLOSSARY \nPART I.
