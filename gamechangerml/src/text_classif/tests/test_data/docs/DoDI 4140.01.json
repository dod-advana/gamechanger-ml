Successful SCRM maintains the integrity of products services people and technologies and ensures the undisrupted flow of product materiel information and finances across the lifecycle of a weapon or support system. DoD SCRM encompasses all subsets of SCRM such as cybersecurity software assurance obsolescence counterfeit parts foreign ownership of subtier vendors and other categories of risk that affect the supply chain. supply chain. The linked activities associated with providing materiel to end users for consumption. Those activities include supply activities such as organic and commercial ICPs and retail supply activities maintenance activities such as organic and commercial depot level maintenance facilities and intermediate repair activities and distribution activities such as distribution depots and other storage locations container consolidation points ports of embarkation and debarkation and ground air and ocean transporters. supply chain management. Meeting customerdriven materiel requirements through the acquisition maintenance transportation storage and delivery of materiel to customers and managing materiel returns movement of reparable materiel to and from maintenance facilities and ensuring the exchange of information among customers maintainers supply chain managers and suppliers. sustainability. Conditions under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony that permit fulfilling the social economic and other requirements of present and future generations. DoDI 4140.01 March 6 2019 GLOSSARY 22 sustainment. For purpose of materiel management the life cycle phase for an item of supply that deals with the planning and execution of materiel management activities starting when the item is introduced into the DoD supply system and ending when a determination is made to remove the item from the DoD supply system. An item can be introduced into the DoD supply system as part of the acquisition of a new weapon system as a new commodity requirement as a replacement for an existing item or as a part of a transition from contractor logistics support to organic support. An item can be removed from the DoD supply system due to obsolescence or the existence of superior replacement item. total item property record. The record or record set maintained by the materiel manager that identifies the quantity condition and value of the items for each organizational entity having physical custody of those items. The total item property record includes materiel that is due in in transit in organic wholesale and retail repair facilities in a contractor\u2019s custody on loan on hand in wholesale distribution centers onhand at retail activities and for reported assets in the custody of users. UII. A set of data elements marked on items that is globally unique and unambiguous. The term includes a concatenated UII or a DoD recognized unique identification equivalent. unique item level traceability. The requirement to trace lifecycle management events related to acquisition storage operation maintenance safety physical security retirement and disposal by each individual item e.g. for a single instance of a stocknumbered item or a single assembly or subassembly.
