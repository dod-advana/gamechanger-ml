Government authorities to fill a wartime need or , if a group was not created specifically for a wartime need , but existed before that time , then its wartime mission was of a nature to substantially alter the organization 's prewar character .4.2.1.1.2 . If the application is based on service in a combat zone , the mission of the group in a combat zone must have been substantially different from the mission of similar groups not in a combat zone .4.2.1.2 . Organizational Authority Over the Group .The concept of military control is reinforced if the military command authority determines such things as the structure of the civilian organization , the location of the group , the mission and activities of the group , and the staffing requirements to include the length of employment and pay grades of the members of the group .4.2.1.3 . Integration into the Military Organization .Integrated civilian groups are subject to the regulations , standards , and control of the military command authority .4.2.1.3.1 .

Bill Improvement Act of 1977 Section 401 November 23 1977 38 U.S.C. 106 Note c Title 10 United States Code Section 802a d Department of Defense Instruction 1336.1 Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty DD Form 2145 Series January 6 1989 e through g see enclosure 1 1. REISSUANCE AND PURPOSE This Directive 1.1. Reissues reference a. 1.2. Implements reference b. 1.3. Directs the Secretary of the Air Force to determine if an established group of civilian employees or contract workers provided service to the U.S. Armed Forces in a manner considered active military service for Department of Veterans Affairs Department of Veterans Affairs benefits. 1.4. Establishes the Department of Defense CivilianMilitary Service Review Board and the Advisory Panel. 1.5. Establishes policy assigns responsibilities prescribes application procedures for groups and individuals and clarifies the factors used to determine active duty AD service. Department of DefenseD 1000.20 September 11 1989 2. APPLICABILITY AND SCOPE This Directive 2.1. Applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense Office of the Secretary of Defense the Military Departments and by agreement with the Department of Transportation Department of Transportation the U.S. Coast Guard. 2.2. Applies to any group application considered under reference b after the effective date of this Directive and to any individual who applies for discharge documents as a member of a group recognized by the Secretary of the Air Force. 3. DEFINITIONS The terms used in this Directive are defined in enclosure 2. 4. POLICY 4.1. Eligibility for Consideration. To be eligible to apply for consideration under P.L. 95202 reference b and this Directive a group must 4.1.1. Have been similarly situated to the Womens Air Forces Service Pilots of World War II. 4.1.2. Have rendered service to the United States in what was considered civilian employment with the U.S. Armed Forces either through formal Civil Service hiring or less formal hiring if the engagement was created under the exigencies of war or as the result of a contract with the U.S. Government to provide direct support to the U.S. Armed Forces. 4.1.3. Have rendered that service during a period of armed conflict. 4.1.4. Consist of living persons to whom Department of Veterans Affairs benefits can accrue. 4.1.5. Not have already received benefits from the Federal Government for the service in question. 4.2. A determination of AD service that is considered to be equivalent to active military service is made on the extent to which the group was under the control of the U.S. Armed Forces in support of a military operation or mission during an armed 2 Department of DefenseD 1000.20 September 11 1989 conflict. The extent of control exerted over the group must be similar to that exerted over military personnel and shall be determined by but not necessarily limited to the following 4.2.1. Incidents Favoring Equivalency 4.2.1.1. Uniqueness of Service. Civilian service civilian employment or contractual service is a vital element of the warfighting capability of the Armed Forces. Civilian service during a period of armed conflict is not necessarily equivalent to active military service even when performed in a combat zone. Service must be beyond that generally performed by civilian employees and must be occasioned by unique circumstances. For civilian service to be recognized under this Directive the following factors must be present 4.2.1.1.1. The group was created or organized by U.S. Government authorities to fill a wartime need or if a group was not created specifically for a wartime need but existed before that time then its wartime mission was of a nature to substantially alter the organizations prewar character. 4.2.1.1.2. If the application is based on service in a combat zone the mission of the group in a combat zone must have been substantially different from the mission of similar groups not in a combat zone. 4.2.1.2. Organizational Authority Over the Group. The concept of military control is reinforced if the military command authority determines such things as the structure of the civilian organization the location of the group the mission and activities of the group and the staffing requirements to include the length of employment and pay grades of the members of the group. 4.2.1.3. Integration into the Military Organization. Integrated civilian groups are subject to the regulations standards and control of the military command authority. 4.2.1.3.1. Examples include the following 4.2.1.3.1.1. Exchanging military courtesies. 4.2.1.3.1.2. Wearing military clothing insignia and devices. 4.2.1.3.1.3. Assimilating the group into the military organizational structure. 4.2.1.3.1.4. Emoluments associated with military personnel i.e. the use of commissaries and exchanges and membership in military clubs. 3 Department of DefenseD 1000.20 September 11 1989 4.2.1.3.2. A group fully integrated into the military would give the impression that the members of the group were military except that they were paid and accounted for as civilians. 4.2.1.3.3. Integration into the military may lead to an expectation by members of the group that the service of the group imminently would be recognized as active military service. Such integration acts in favor of recognition. 4.2.1.4. Subjection to Military Discipline. During past armed conflicts U.S. military commanders sometimes restricted the rights or liberties of civilian members as if they were military members. 4.2.1.4.1. Examples include the following 4.2.1.4.1.1. Placing members under a curfew. 4.2.1.4.1.2. Requiring members to work extended hours or unusual shifts. 4.2.1.4.1.3. Changing duty assignments and responsibilities. 4.2.1.4.1.4. Restricting proximity travel to and from the military installation. 4.2.1.4.1.5. Imposing dress and grooming standards. 4.2.1.4.2. Consequences for noncompliance might include a loss of some privilege dismissal from the group or trial under military law. Such military discipline acts in favor of recognition. 4.2.1.5. Subjection to Military Justice. Military members are subject to the military criminal justice system. During times of war persons serving with or accompanying an Armed Force in the field are subject to the military criminal justice code reference c. Those who were SERVING WITH the U.S. Armed Forces may have been treated as if they were military and subjected to courtmartial jurisdiction to maintain discipline. Such treatment is a factor in favor of recognition. 4.2.1.6. Prohibition Against Members of the Group Joining the Armed Forces. Some organizations may have been formed to serve in a military capacity to overcome the operation of existing laws or treaty or because of a governmentally established policy to retain individuals in the group as part of a civilian force. These factors act in favor of recognition. 4 Department of DefenseD 1000.20 September 11 1989 4.2.1.7. Receipt of Military Training andor Achievement of Military Capability. If a group employed skills or resources that were enhanced as the result of military training or equipment designed or issued for that purpose this acts toward recognition. 4.2.2. Incidents Not Favoring Equivalency 4.2.2.1. Submission to the U.S. Armed Forces for Protection. A group that seeks protection and assistance from the U.S. Armed Forces and submits to military control for its own wellbeing is not deemed to have provided service to the Armed Forces equivalent to AD military service even though the group may have been as follows 4.2.2.1.1. Armed by the U.S. military for defensive purposes. 4.2.2.1.2. Routed by the U.S. military to avoid the enemy. 4.2.2.1.3. Instructed by the U.S. military for the defense of the group when attacked by or in danger of attack by the enemy. 4.2.2.1.4. Otherwise submitted themselves to the U.S. military for sustenance and protection. 4.2.2.2. Permitted to Resign. The ability of members to resign at will and without penalty acts against military control. Penalty may be direct and severe such as confinement or indirect and moderate such as difficult and costly transportation from an overseas location. 4.2.2.3. Prior Recognition of Group Service. Recognition of a groups service by agencies of State or local government does not provide support in favor of recognition under this Directive. 4.2.3. Status of Group in International Law. In addition to other factors consideration will be given to whether members of the group were regarded and treated as civilians or assimilated to the Armed Forces as reflected in treaties customary international law judicial decisions and U.S. diplomatic practice. 4.3. Reconsideration. Applications by groups previously denied a favorable determination by the Secretary of the Air Force shall be reconsidered under this Directive if the group submits evidence that is new relevant and substantive. Any request that the Department of Defense CivilianMilitary Service Review Board established hereunder see paragraph 5.2. determines does not provide new relevant and substantive evidence shall be returned to the applicant with the reasons for nonacceptance. 5 Department of DefenseD 1000.20 September 11 1989 4.4. Counsel Representation. Neither the Department of Defense nor Department of Transportation shall provide representation by counsel or defray the cost of such representation with respect to any matter covered by this Directive. 5. RESPONSIBILITIES 5.1. The Assistant Secretary of Defense Force Management and Personnel ASDFMP shall 5.1.1.

REISSUANCE AND PURPOSE \nThis Directive:  \n1.1.  Reissues reference (a).\n1.2.  Implements reference (b).\n1.3.  Directs the Secretary of the Air Force to determine if an established group of \ncivilian employees or contract workers provided service to the U.S. Armed Forces in a \nmanner considered active military service for Department of Veterans Affairs (Department of Veterans Affairs) \nbenefits.   \n1.4.  Establishes the Department of Defense Civilian/Military Service Review Board and the Advisory \nPanel.   \n1.5.  Establishes policy, assigns responsibilities, prescribes application procedures \nfor groups and individuals, and clarifies the factors used to determine active duty (AD) \nservice.   \nDepartment of DefenseD 1000.20, September 11, 1989 \n \n2.  APPLICABILITY AND SCOPE \nThis Directive:  \n2.1.  Applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (Office of the Secretary of Defense), the Military \nDepartments, and by agreement with the Department of Transportation (Department of Transportation), the U.S. \nCoast Guard.   \n2.2.  Applies to any group application considered under reference (b) after the \neffective date of this Directive and to any individual who applies for discharge \ndocuments as a member of a group recognized by the Secretary of the Air Force.   \n \n3.  DEFINITIONS \nThe terms used in this Directive are defined in enclosure 2.\n \n4.  POLICY \n4.1.  Eligibility for Consideration.  To be eligible to apply for consideration under \nP.L. 95-202 (reference (b)) and this Directive, a group must:  \n4.1.1.  Have been similarly situated to the Women's Air Forces Service Pilots \nof World War II.   \n4.1.2.  Have rendered service to the United States in what was considered \ncivilian employment with the U.S. Armed Forces either through formal Civil Service \nhiring or less formal hiring if the engagement was created under the exigencies of war, or \nas the result of a contract with the U.S. Government to provide direct support to the U.S. \nArmed Forces.   \n4.1.3.  Have rendered that service during a period of armed conflict.   \n4.1.4.  Consist of living persons to whom Department of Veterans Affairs benefits can accrue.   \n4.1.5.  Not have already received benefits from the Federal Government for the \nservice in question.   \n4.2.  A determination of AD service that is considered to be equivalent to active \nmilitary service is made on the extent to which the group was under the control of the \nU.S. Armed Forces in support of a military operation or mission during an armed  \n \n2\nDepartment of DefenseD 1000.20, September 11, 1989 \nconflict.  The extent of control exerted over the group must be similar to that exerted over \nmilitary personnel and shall be determined by, but not necessarily limited to, the \nfollowing:  \n4.2.1.  Incidents Favoring Equivalency \n4.2.1.1.  Uniqueness of Service.  Civilian service (civilian employment or \ncontractual service) is a vital element of the war-fighting capability of the Armed Forces.  \nCivilian service during a period of armed conflict is not necessarily equivalent to active \nmilitary service, even when performed in a combat zone.  Service must be beyond that \ngenerally performed by civilian employees and must be occasioned by unique \ncircumstances.  For civilian service to be recognized under this Directive, the following \nfactors must be present:  \n4.2.1.1.1.  The group was created or organized by U.S.  Government \nauthorities to fill a wartime need or, if a group was not created specifically for a wartime \nneed, but existed before that time, then its wartime mission was of a nature to \nsubstantially alter the organization's prewar character.   \n4.2.1.1.2.  If the application is based on service in a combat zone, the \nmission of the group in a combat zone must have been substantially different from the \nmission of similar groups not in a combat zone.   \n4.2.1.2.  Organizational Authority Over the Group.  The concept of \nmilitary control is reinforced if the military command authority determines such things as \nthe structure of the civilian organization, the location of the group, the mission and \nactivities of the group, and the staffing requirements to include the length of employment \nand pay grades of the members of the group.   \n4.2.1.3.  Integration into the Military Organization.  Integrated civilian \ngroups are subject to the regulations, standards, and control of the military command \nauthority.   \n4.2.1.3.1.  Examples include the following:  \n4.2.1.3.1.1.  Exchanging military courtesies.   \n4.2.1.3.1.2.  Wearing military clothing, insignia, and devices.   \n4.2.1.3.1.3.  Assimilating the group into the military \norganizational structure.   \n4.2.1.3.1.4.  Emoluments associated with military personnel; i.e., \nthe use of commissaries and exchanges, and membership in military clubs.   \n \n3\nDepartment of DefenseD 1000.20, September 11, 1989 \n4.2.1.3.2.  A group fully integrated into the military would give the \nimpression that the members of the group were military, except that they were paid and \naccounted for as civilians.   \n4.2.1.3.3.  Integration into the military may lead to an expectation by \nmembers of the group that the service of the group imminently would be recognized as \nactive military service.  Such integration acts in favor of recognition.   \n4.2.1.4.  Subjection to Military Discipline.  During past armed conflicts, \nU.S.  military commanders sometimes restricted the rights or liberties of civilian \nmembers as if they were military members.   \n4.2.1.4.1.  Examples include the following:  \n4.2.1.4.1.1.  Placing members under a curfew.   \n4.2.1.4.1.2.  Requiring members to work extended hours or \nunusual shifts.   \n4.2.1.4.1.3.  Changing duty assignments and responsibilities.   \n4.2.1.4.1.4.  Restricting proximity travel to and from the military \ninstallation.   \n4.2.1.4.1.5.  Imposing dress and grooming standards.   \n4.2.1.4.2.  Consequences for noncompliance might include a loss of \nsome privilege, dismissal from the group, or trial under military law.  Such military \ndiscipline acts in favor of recognition.   \n4.2.1.5.  Subjection to Military Justice.  Military members are subject to \nthe military criminal justice system.  During times of war, \"persons serving with or \naccompanying an Armed Force in the field\" are subject to the military criminal justice \ncode (reference (c)). Those who were SERVING WITH the U.S. Armed Forces may have \nbeen treated as if they were military and subjected to court-martial jurisdiction to \nmaintain discipline.  Such treatment is a factor in favor of recognition.   \n4.2.1.6.  Prohibition Against Members of the Group Joining the Armed \nForces.  Some organizations may have been formed to serve in a military capacity to \novercome the operation of existing laws or treaty or because of a governmentally \nestablished policy to retain individuals in the group as part of a civilian force.  These \nfactors act in favor of recognition.   \n \n \n4\nDepartment of DefenseD 1000.20, September 11, 1989 \n4.2.1.7.  Receipt of Military Training and/or Achievement of Military \nCapability.  If a group employed skills or resources that were enhanced as the result of \nmilitary training or equipment designed or issued for that purpose, this acts toward \nrecognition.   \n4.2.2.  Incidents Not Favoring Equivalency \n4.2.2.1.  Submission to the U.S.  Armed Forces for Protection.  A group \nthat seeks protection and assistance from the U.S.  Armed Forces and submits to military \ncontrol for its own well-being is not deemed to have provided service to the Armed \nForces equivalent to AD military service, even though the group may have been as \nfollows:  \n4.2.2.1.1.  Armed by the U.S. military for defensive purposes.   \n4.2.2.1.2.  Routed by the U.S. military to avoid the enemy.   \n4.2.2.1.3.  Instructed by the U.S. military for the defense of the group \nwhen attacked by, or in danger of attack by, the enemy.   \n4.2.2.1.4.  Otherwise submitted themselves to the U.S. military for \nsustenance and protection.   \n4.2.2.2.  Permitted to Resign.  The ability of members to resign at will and \nwithout penalty acts against military control.  Penalty may be direct and severe, such as \nconfinement, or indirect and moderate, such as difficult and costly transportation from an \noverseas location.   \n4.2.2.3.  Prior Recognition of Group Service.  Recognition of a group's \nservice by agencies of State or local government does not provide support in favor of \nrecognition under this Directive.   \n4.2.3.  Status of Group in International Law.  In addition to other factors, \nconsideration will be given to whether members of the group were regarded and treated \nas civilians, or assimilated to the Armed Forces as reflected in treaties, customary \ninternational law, judicial decisions, and U.S. diplomatic practice.   \n4.3.  Reconsideration.  Applications by groups previously denied a favorable \ndetermination by the Secretary of the Air Force shall be reconsidered under this Directive \nif the group submits evidence that is new, relevant, and substantive.  Any request that the \nDepartment of Defense Civilian/Military Service Review Board established hereunder (see paragraph 5.2.) \ndetermines does not provide new, relevant, and substantive evidence shall be returned to \nthe applicant with the reasons for non-acceptance.   \n \n5\nDepartment of DefenseD 1000.20, September 11, 1989 \n4.4.  Counsel Representation.  Neither the Department of Defense nor Department of \nTransportation shall provide representation by counsel or defray the cost of such \nrepresentation with respect to any matter covered by this Directive.   \n \n5.  RESPONSIBILITIES \n5.1.  The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Force Management and Personnel) \n(ASD(FM&P)) shall:  \n5.1.1.  Appoint a primary and an alternate member in the grade of O-6 or GM-\n15 or higher to the Department of Defense Civilian/Military Service Review Board.   \n5.1.2.
