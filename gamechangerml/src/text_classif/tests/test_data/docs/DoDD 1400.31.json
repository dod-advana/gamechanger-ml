Does not apply to United Nations, Department of State (DoS), other Federal \nemployees, nor other U.S. or foreign national citizens. \n \n3.  DEFINITIONS \n3.1.  DoD Civilian Work Force.  U.S. citizens or foreign nationals hired directly or \nindirectly to work for the Department of Defense, paid from appropriated or \nnonappropriated funds under permanent or temporary appointment.  This includes \nemployees filling full-time, part-time, intermittent, or on-call positions.  Specifically \nexcluded are all Government contractor employees.  Contingency and emergency \nplanning for contractor employees is covered by DoD Directive 3020.37 (reference (h)). \n3.2.  DoD Installation.  Any post, camp, station, depot, base, laboratory, or similar \nactivity of the DoD Components that employs members of the DoD civilian work force in \npeacetime or will employ them in the event of mobilization. \n \n4.  POLICY \n4.1.  The DoD civilian work force shall be prepared to respond rapidly, efficiently, \nand effectively to meet mission requirements for all contingencies and emergencies. \n4.2.  Plans, programs, contingency and emergency manpower requirements, and an \nappropriate state of readiness, including organization infrastructure, shall be developed as \nan integral part of the continuing activities of each DoD Component to ensure the \npreparedness required by paragraph 4.1., above.  These plans, programs, and \nrequirements shall be governed by policies and procedures in 50 U.S.C. 403, 50 U.S.C. \n2061, 50 U.S.C. 2251-2297, and E.O. 12656 (references (c) through (f)); host-nation \nsupport agreements (HNSA); and supplemental guidance issued by the Department of \nDefense; the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); the Office of \nManagement and Budget; the Department of Labor (DoL); and the Office of Personnel \nDODD 1400.31, April 28, 1995 \n \n3\nManagement (OPM) as well as by DoD policies, procedures, and planning assumptions \nin the DoD Master Mobilization Guide, DoD Directive 1100.18, DoD Instruction \n1100.19, and Joint Pub 4-05 (references (i) through (l)), and any subsequent supplemental \nguidance. \n4.3.  Members of the DoD civilian work force shall remain in or deploy to areas of \ncontingencies and emergencies to provide essential support to military operations, as \nrequired.  Management has the authority to direct and assign civilian employees, either \nvoluntarily, involuntarily or on an unexpected basis to accomplish the DoD mission \nunder provisions of DoD Directive 1404.10 (reference (m)). \n4.4.  As an integral part of the total force under DoD Directive 1100.4 (reference \n(n)), the deployed civilian work force shall be under Unified Combatant Commander \noperational control when employed in or deployed to theaters of operations and shall be \nprocessed and supported in the same manner as military personnel of their employing \nComponent, as permissible by law and/or existing status of forces agreements (SOFAs) \nwith foreign nations.  To facilitate this control and support, every civilian employee \nremaining in or deploying to a theater of operations shall be assigned or attached to a \ngaining activity unit identification code (UIC) within the theater upon the decision to \nretain a civilian employee in a theater of potential conflict or before deploying that \nemployee.  This UIC will be stated on the deployee's temporary duty (TDY) orders. \n4.5.  Theater admission requirements for civilian employees deploying to a theater \nof operations shall be expeditiously established during the deliberation and execution \nplanning processes by the Unified Combatant Commander and complied with by the \ndeploying Component.  For civilian employees already in a theater of operations when \ntheater admission requirements are declared or updated, the in-theater unit to which the \nemployee is assigned or attached is responsible for compliance. \n4.6.  If local nationals are employed in a theater of operations in peacetime, \ncommanders shall follow their DoD Component's established procedures when \nemploying them in contingencies and emergencies.  If peacetime procedures are not \nestablished when a contingency or emergency begins, commanders shall obtain the \nrequired support through local contracted services. \n \n5.  RESPONSIBILITIES \n5.1.  The Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness shall: \n5.1.1.

Establish broad policies and assumptions for DoD Component \ndevelopment of contingency and emergency civilian work force manpower requirements. \n5.1.4.

Represent the Department of Defense with the DoS, FEMA, OPM, DoL, \nand other Federal Agencies to coordinate national and international policies affecting the \nDoD civilian work force, as required. \n5.1.6.  Review the DoD Components' civilian work force contingency and \nemergency assumptions, plans programs, and requirements to ensure that they are \nsufficiently flexible and readily adaptable to a variety of contingency or emergency \nsituations.  This review process shall take place annually or as required by changing \ncircumstances.  The review of requirements shall specifically assess sufficiency of \nnumbers, skills and experience and, where DoD Components have identified shortfalls, \nshall jointly explore alternatives for alleviating those shortfalls. \n5.1.7.  Develop any needed legislation, regulation or authorities needed to \nenhance the flexible management of the civilian work force in order to support \ncontingencies and emergencies. \n5.1.8.  Test and evaluate civilian work force contingency and emergency plans, \nprograms, requirements, and readiness in exercises and implement any necessary changes \narising from exercise evaluations and real-life experiences. \n5.1.9.  Ensure that the Ready Reserve under DoD Directive 1200.7 (reference \n(n)) and military retirees under DoD Directive 1352.1 (reference (o)) are screened \nperiodically so that their recall to military duty shall not impair essential DoD and other \nFederal functions and shall ensure that emergency-essential and key employees under \nDoD Directives 1404.10, 1200.7, and 1352.1 (references (m), (o), and (p)) are exempted \nfrom recall to military duty. \n5.2.  The Under Secretary of Defense for Policy shall provide DoD national defense \npolicy guidance for developing DoD contingency and emergency plans. \n5.3.  The Comptroller of the Department of Defense shall provide DoD funding \nguidance to DoD Components to assist in planning for and execution of DoD civilian \nwork force response to contingencies and emergencies. \nDODD 1400.31, April 28, 1995 \n \n5\n5.4.

(reference (q)). \n5.6.  The Heads of the DoD Components shall develop, maintain, and exercise \ncivilian contingency and emergency plans and procedures (e.g., staffing arrangements, \nstandby emergency implementing documents) to implement the latest Defense planning \nguidance and DoD policy.  Such plans and procedures shall prepare the civilian work \nforce for employment and deployment to support all contingencies and emergencies \nrapidly, efficiently, and effectively.  Ensure that non-essential civilian employees who are \nevacuated from areas of contingencies or emergencies are, to the maximum extent \npossible, expeditiously reassigned under DoD Directive 3025.14 (reference (r)).  Plans \nand procedures shall be coordinated with other DoD Components, if they are affected. \n5.7.  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall incorporate guidance for theater \nadmission requirements for civilian employees into JOPES Volumes I and II.  The basic \nreference for such requirements is DoD 4500.54-G, (reference (s)).  This policy shall be \nsupplemented in contingencies and emergencies by additional guidance in Commander-\nIn-Chief concept plans and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff deployment orders \n(personnel annexes) as described in JOPES Volume I. \n5.8.  The Commanders of the Unified Combatant Commands shall: \n5.8.1.  Expeditiously issue theater admission requirements for civilians. \n5.8.2.
