How to use the testing script:

python3 model_test.py

It will pull down the latest models and corpus from s3 and assess the models against that, then delete the model and json files when it's done.

To use testing script on local models:
Make sure all the model files are in the current working directory. Then:

python3 model_test.py --local

This will only pull the corpus json files from s3 and only assess the models in the current directory.

To use verbosity:

python3 model_test.py --verbose

To use gold standard test (against the gold_standard.csv, its layout is query | expected results separated by ;):
python3 model_test.py --gold_standard

To use iteration (get recall @ k, it will get the top 5 to top 50 documents from inference iterating by 5):
python3 model_test.py --iterate
