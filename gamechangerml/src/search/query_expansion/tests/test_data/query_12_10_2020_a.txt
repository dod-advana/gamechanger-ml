GRIEVANCE SYSTEM
Enterprise-wide business reforms are one of the Secretary of Defense’s priorities for modernizing the Department. Specifically, the National Defense Strategy’s (NDS) third line of effort, Reform the Department for Greater Performance and Affordability, is fundamentally changing the way DoD does business. The Department is committed to reforming and transforming itself for greater performance and affordability and has identified critical areas to target. The Department’s first-ever self-audit, completed in November 2018, provided a wealth of insights and data that can contribute to DoD’s NDS efforts. The audit results are an historic accomplishment and demonstrate DoD’s commitment to accountability and reform. The audit has also generated significant financial and operations data whereby leadership can harness opportunities for reform and ensure more efficient stewardship of taxpayer resources. In his January 2, 2020 memo, Message to the Force - Reform through Focused Prioritization, the Secretary noted, “Given our limited resources, we must find the right balance between spending on the needs of today and investing for tomorrow. The trade-off between current readiness and future modernization is one of our most difficult decisions. Getting this right requires a deliberate budgeting process and continual assessment.” The 2018 audit data provides a very unique opportunity in “getting this right” more efficiently and effectively. Therefore, on August 3, 2020, the Deputy Secretary of Defense directed the Defense Business Board to establish a task group to examine the 2018 audit data in light of how private industry leverages similar audit and performance related data to inform strategic decision making and assist Department executives in maximizing the efficacy and effectiveness of their business operations.
