# Tests for section_classifier

## Prerequisites

- Follow setup instructions in the repository's [main README](../../../../README.md#getting-started).

## Run Tests

1. In a terminal, `cd` into your local `gamechanger-ml` repository.
2. Use the following command, but replace `<test file name>` with the name of the test file you want to run.
   ```
   python -m unittest gamechangerml/src/section_classifier/<test file name>
   ```
3. Results will print to the terminal.
   - Note: The tests use `failfast=True`, so they will stop running after the first failure.
