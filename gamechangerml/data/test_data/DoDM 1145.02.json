If an applicant is in medical processing and the test scores reveal the applicant has not met Service standards the medical processing will continue to complete the medical examination process. 4.7. ASVAB RETESTING. a. Retest publicationolicy for Enlistment and Student ASVAB. After taking an initial ASVAB an individual can retest 1 calendar month after the initial test 1 calendar month after the first retest and every 6 calendar months thereafter. 1 An applicant administered an ASVAB test within 2 years of any previous ASVAB test is considered to have received a retest. 2 An applicant who answers at least one ASVAB question is considered to have tested establishing retest eligibility. 3 The retest policy applies to any enlistment test taken and a student test when used for enlistment purposes. Department of DefenseM 1145.02 July 23 2018 SECTION 4 ApublicationTITUDE STANDARDS 28 4 When retested a complete ASVAB is administered and the results of a valid test become the applicant\u2019s score of record. 5 If an applicant is retested with the same test version within a 6month period or before the required time between previous test and retest the retest score will be invalidated and the previous test score will stand as the score of record. However if this condition is the result of a USMEpublicationCOM clerical or administrative error an immediate retest using a different ASVAB version may be authorized by the MEpublicationS commander. 6 Individuals in the DEpublication will not be retested except for inquiry into possible testing improprieties. If an individual is tested inadvertently while in the DEpublication the resulting test scores are invalid. b. Retest Functions for Enlistment and Student ASVAB. 1 The headquarters USMEpublicationCOM J3 Operations Testing Division can authorize MEpublicationS commanders to retest for USMEpublicationCOM not Service error for example instances where testing occurred under adverse conditions such as a fire evacuation. J3 may also authorize a retest when it is believed an individual\u2019s scores do not reflect his or her true ability. 2 The headquarters USMEpublicationCOM J3 Operations Testing Division can authorize MEpublicationS commanders to retest an applicant who through no fault of the applicant is precluded from completing the test e.g. called away from the test session due to an emergency. This does not include illness that existed before the test session since the applicant is cautioned not to take the test if ill. 3 The MEpublicationS commander may require an applicant to retest when the MEpublicationS commander operations officer or TCOalternate TCO upon interviewing the applicant have reasonable cause to suspect improper means were employed to influence or inflate test scores. The retest will be taken at the MEpublicationS. 4 If the results of a mandatory retest demonstrate that a testing impropriety occurred during the original test or if such impropriety is determined during an appropriate interview all associated retest results for that applicant will be invalidated and the individual will be prohibited from voluntary retesting for 6 months. When eligible to retest all retests must be taken in the MEpublicationS. 5 When a Service errs in the application of established testing policy the MApublicationWG policy member from the Service concerned may request an exception to testing policy so that a retest can be administered. Both the Service MApublicationWG and USMEpublicationCOM staff must concur that an exception is appropriate for recommendation to be forwarded to the MApublicationWG Chair for decision. 6 USMEpublicationCOM will administer a mandatory confirmation retest when an applicant gains 20 or more AFQT percentile points. This gain is compared to the most recent valid test score received within the previous 6 months. Results of a confirmation test are not valid for enlistment. When a confirmation test is directed a complete ASVAB is administered. Department of DefenseM 1145.02 July 23 2018 SECTION 4 ApublicationTITUDE STANDARDS 29 Confirmation test results will be reviewed as outlined in USMEpublicationCOM policies and procedures covering enlistment qualification test program. c.

Testing publicationolicy.  \n(1)  Enlistment qualification tests will not be administered to applicants who are \notherwise ineligible for enlistment. \n(2)  The recruiting Service is responsible for ensuring that the applicant meets basic \neligibility requirements to enlist before sponsoring an individual for MEpublicationS or MET site ASVAB \ntesting. \n(3)  The USMEpublicationCOM Form 680-3A-E \u201cRequest for Examination,\u201d available on the \nUSMEpublicationCOM website, is required to authorize the applicant\u2019s enlistment qualification testing or \nretesting.  Accuracy of the data elements on the form is the responsibility of the applicant and the \nrecruiter.  The ASVAB will not be administered to any applicant unless a fully completed and \ncertified USMEpublicationCOM Form 680-3A-E is presented before testing.   \n(4)  The enlistment ASVAB is solely for the testing of individuals specifically applying \nfor enlistment.  The enlistment ASVAB is not to test students in educational institutions. \n(5)  Testing applicants for enlistment with the ASVAB by other than MEpublicationS-designated \npersonnel is not authorized, except utilizing the online un-proctored ASVAB or in overseas \nareas. \n(6)  The ASVAB scores are valid for enlistment purposes, including the DEpublication, for 2 years \nfrom the date of test administration.  In all cases, the most recent valid ASVAB score is the score \nof record and is the only score that can be used for enlistment processing purposes. \n(7)  To take the enlistment ASVAB, applicants must provide photographic identification \n(e.g., driver\u2019s license, student identification card, military dependent identification card, or \npassport) to the test administrator (TA).  Applicants without photographic identification will be \nrequired to have their right thumbprint imprinted on the USMEpublicationCOM Form 680-3A-E.  \nApplicants without photographic identification and who refuse to render a thumbprint will be \ndenied the opportunity to test.   \n(8)  During processing, applicant signatures will be compared to ensure proper applicant \nidentification.  Locations operating with USMEpublicationCOM identity management software do not \nrequire the applicant to present photographic identification or manually thumbprint an applicant \non USMEpublicationCOM Form 680-3A-E before testing.  \nDepartment of DefenseM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 4:  ApublicationTITUDE STANDARDS  \n19 \n(9)  publicationersonnel in the DEpublication will not retest with the enlistment or student ASVAB. \n(10)  The first ASVAB administered, whether in the enlistment or student program, is the \ninitial test of an applicant.  An exception is a test administered in the school testing program to a \nstudent in the 10th grade; this test cannot be used for enlistment purposes, and therefore it does \nnot count as a first test.  Any subsequent testing with the ASVAB, enlistment or student, within \n2 years of any previous test is considered a retest; retest policy is addressed in publicationaragraph 4.7 of \nthis issuance. \n(11)  An applicant who has answered at least one question on the ASVAB is considered \nto have tested. \n(12)  A TA is not authorized to test an individual who, in their judgment, appears to be \nunder the influence of alcohol or drugs. \n(13)  Under normal circumstances, the applicant\u2019s test results will only be provided to the \nsponsoring recruiting Service.  Test results will not be given directly to the applicant after \ntesting. \n(14)  Cameras, cellular telephones, or any other personal electronic devices are prohibited \nwithin any testing area. \n(15)  Applicants detected receiving or using unauthorized assistance (e.g., unauthorized \nnotes or study questions, talking during the test, or gazing onto a neighbor\u2019s test), or committing \nother inappropriate conduct (e.g., working on a portion of the test other than the one being \nadministered, or using a calculator, slide rule, cellular telephone, electronic translator, or other \nmechanical device) will not be allowed to continue to test.  If testing is complete, their test \nresults will be invalidated. \n(16)  Applicants leaving the test room without authorization will have their test results \ninvalidated. \n(17)  In all cases where a test is invalidated, the individual will be prohibited from further \ntesting for 6 calendar months.  Additionally, results of an invalidated test cannot be used for \nenlistment purposes. \n(18)  In addition to administering the ASVAB, MEpublicationS personnel are authorized to \nadminister approved special purpose tests.  Special purpose testing will not be scheduled or \nconducted in a manner that impairs the ability of the MEpublicationS concerned to complete enlistment or \nstudent testing missions.  \u201cSpecial publicationurpose Testing\u201d is explained in publicationaragraph 4.4 of this \nissuance. \n(19)  The MEpublicationS TA will not administer the ASVAB to other personnel (military or \ncivilian) assigned to the same MEpublicationS. \n(20)  At paper-and-pencil MET sites, only the unverified Armed Forces Qualification \nTest (AFQT) score may be released to the sponsoring recruiting Service.

Applicants may be advised that commercial study guides are available; \nhowever, commercial study guides will not be maintained in any MEpublicationS or MET site facility, or \nin the possession of MEpublicationS and recruiting personnel for use by applicants.  The MEpublicationS and \nrecruiting personnel will not participate in applicant study preparation, nor provide or \nrecommend actions that would afford an applicant with an unfair advantage towards improving \nASVAB scores.  The TAs will report anyone seeking inappropriate testing assistance to the \nMEpublicationS commander. \nc.

The Department of Defense STpublication, also known as the CEpublication, provides names of \npotential recruits to the Military Services. \n(2)  The ASVAB is a major component of the CEpublication.   information technology has been shown to predict future \noccupational and academic success. \n(3)  Specific forms of the ASVAB belong to the Department of Defense STpublication. \n(4)  The Department of Defense offers the ASVAB program to schools at no cost. \n(5)  The ASVAB results, integrated with individual interest assessments and personal \npreferences, enable students to explore suitable careers for themselves.   information technology is also useful to the \nServices to identify students eligible for military service and assignment to military occupational \ntraining programs.  Various options are available to permit or restrict recruiter contact with \nstudents after schools receive the scores. \nb.  Testing publicationolicy.  \nDepartment of DefenseM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 4:  ApublicationTITUDE STANDARDS  \n22 \n(1)  Testing in educational institutions with any form of the enlistment ASVAB, \nincluding enlistment screening tests, is prohibited per Department of DefenseI 1304.12E.  However, the results of \nthe student ASVAB can be used for enlistment up to 2 years following the date of the test for \n11th and 12th graders.  Test results for 10th graders cannot be used for enlistment.  Scores \nreported for students who take the student test while in an applicant status are invalid for \nenlistment. \n(2)  The MEpublicationS assigned responsibility for the school concerned will provide test \nmaterials to the school, and will administer, score, and report the results of testing to the school. \n(3)  The school participating in Department of Defense STpublication testing will provide a suitable well-lit and \nventilated room that is free of extraneous noise and interruptions, as well a 3 \u00bd hour block of \ntime to conduct the test; less time may be required if the tests are electronically administered. \n(4)  Students in the 9th grade will not be tested.  There are no nationally representative \nnorms for this age group.  If 9th grade students are inadvertently tested, their answer sheets will \nbe destroyed and not scored. \n(5)  The recruiting Service and school administration will establish formal procedures to \ncontrol the distribution, access, and retention of ASVAB data on individual students tested in the \n11th and 12th grades. \n(6)  Student scores will be provided to school counselors for use in programs that support \neducational and career counseling. \n(7)  When discussing test results with students, recruiting personnel will encourage \nstudents to graduate from High School before enlisting into a Military Service. \n(8)  Information on an individual\u2019s identity and related test information will not be \nreleased to any agency outside of the student\u2019s school system and the Department of Defense. \n(9)  The IReserve Component is responsible for proctor support. \n(10)  Additional student testing policy and procedures are defined in USMEpublicationCOM \npolicies and procedures. \n4.4.

SERVICE ASVAB TESTING publicationROGRAM.  The Military Services are responsible for the \nArmed Forces Classification Test and the overseas ETpublication.   \na.  Armed Forces Classification Test (AFCT).  \n(1)  publicationrogram Description. \n(a)  The AFCT is the in-Service test that evaluates individuals on the same aptitude \nareas as the enlistment ASVAB. \n(b)  The AFCT, like the ASVAB, assesses aptitude for training and is a proven and \nvalid predictor of success in initial entry training programs. \n(c)  The AFCT will always be administered in its entirety. \n(d)  The AFCT, along with the in-service education, job experience and training, is \nuseful to support personnel decisions on an individual\u2019s potential for advancement or specialized \ntraining. \n(e)  As new ASVAB forms are introduced into the ETpublication, no less than two forms of the \npredecessor enlistment ASVAB will be designated for an AFCT. \n(f)  The OpublicationA will recommend different forms or versions of the ASVAB for an \nAFCT to the MApublicationWG.  The MApublicationWG will make a recommendation to approve or disapprove \nthe OpublicationA recommendation to the Director, Accession publicationolicy. \nDepartment of DefenseM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 4:  ApublicationTITUDE STANDARDS  \n24 \n(g)  Answer sheets, administration instructions, directions for scoring, and scoring \nkeys, will carry the AFCT title. \n(h)  The cover and numbering of the AFCT will be distinct from ASVAB \nidentification. \n(i)  The MApublicationWG must concur with any alteration to AFCT test booklets or test \ncomponents. \n(j)  The Military Service concerned is responsible for printing and reprinting all \nAFCT materials.  \n(k)  The MApublicationWG will determine procedures to print, reprint, and manage \ncomputerized versions of the AFCT to support the requirements of the Service concerned. \n(2)  Testing publicationolicy. \n(a)  Each Military Service will establish policies, procedures, and responsibilities for \nadministering their respective in-service testing programs for determining the qualification of \nindividuals for in-service placement and programs.  \n(b)  The AFCT is administered only in its entirety (all ASVAB subtests). \n(c)  To ensure ASVAB security, consistent with ASVAB policy, only Service-\ndesignated test control officers (TCOs) and TAs will handle AFCT materials. \n(d)  The loss or compromise of a single AFCT test battery jeopardizes not only the \nAFCT, but also more importantly, the larger ASVAB testing program.  Loss or compromise of \ntest materials requires completion of an administrative investigation by the Military Service \nconcerned.  Such investigations will be submitted to the Director, Accession publicationolicy, via the first \ngeneral or flag officer in the Service\u2019s chain of command and via Commander, USMEpublicationCOM.  \nThe Military Services will issue appropriate policies to safeguard AFCT materials.  The \nfollowing are prohibited actions that constitute loss or compromise of test materials: \n1.  Access to test by unauthorized personnel. \n2.  Discussion of test questions with unauthorized personnel. \n3.  Examinee revealing test questions to other Service members. \n4.  Questioning of examinees by anyone for the purpose of gaining knowledge of \ntest contents. \n5.  Development of a local or practice test that contains actual test material.  This \nincludes coaching practices at the test center concerned utilizing locally developed test questions, \ntest aids, or commercial test study guides to familiarize an individual with a test. \n6.  Reproduction of any test materials in whole or in part. \nDepartment of DefenseM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 4:  ApublicationTITUDE STANDARDS  \n25 \n7.  Removal of test material by an examinee from the test room. \n8.  Leaving examinees unsupervised during a test session. \n9.  Failure to account for accountable test material at any time. \n10.

Suspected incidents of training courses or sessions using questions from test \nbooklets or emphasizing information known to be covered by the test, which is coaching. \n14.  Tampering with any package containing test material. \n15.  Improper storage of test material. \n16.  Access by unauthorized personnel to any safe or secured container containing \ntest material. \n17.  Theft of test material by any individual. \n18.  Use of unauthorized notes, study questions, or an unauthorized testing aid. \n(e)  Each Service testing program will notify its Service MApublicationWG member of any \ninstance of compromise or possible compromise of accountable and controlled material. \n(f)  The Service MApublicationWG member will immediately report by memorandum all instances \nof actual test loss or possible compromise of accountable and controlled material to the Chair, \npublicationolicy Committee.  At a minimum, the memorandum will include test site location and date, \npurpose and size of session, circumstances surrounding incident, action taken to investigate, \nprojected time to complete investigation, and action regarding continued use of lost or \ncompromised test version.  Upon completion of the investigation required by publicationaragraph \n4.5.b.(2)(d) of this issuance, a final report will be submitted to the publicationolicy Committee that \nincludes corrective action taken to prevent recurrence.  A vote by the publicationolicy Committee will \ndetermine whether the Service concerned will continue to use the test version in its in-service \ntesting program. \nb.  Overseas Testing publicationrogram. \n(1)  publicationrogram Description. \n(a)  The overseas testing program provides student and enlistment ASVAB testing for \npersons residing outside of the United States. \n(b)  The Military Services are responsible for operation of the overseas testing \nprogram, except for testing in U.S. territories which is the responsibility of USMEpublicationCOM. \nDepartment of DefenseM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 4:  ApublicationTITUDE STANDARDS  \n26 \n(c)  Each Service MApublicationWG representative will identify an ASVAB overseas program \nmanager for their respective Service to provide close coordination with USMEpublicationCOM J3 \nOperations Testing Division. \n(2)  publicationolicy. \n(a)  Appointment orders must be issued authorizing the test examiner to administer \nboth the student and enlistment ASVAB.  TCO appointment orders are to be signed by the test \nexaminer\u2019s commander and maintained on file by the Service ASVAB overseas program \nmanager. \n(b)  The ASVAB will always be administered in its entirety. \n(c)  The ASVAB test will be administered and mailed only by an authorized TCO or \nTA. \n(d)  Overseas Services TCOs or TAs will administer the student and enlistment \nASVAB in accordance with the appropriate manual for the administration of the enlistment or \nstudent versions of the test. \n(e)  Enlistment tests will be scored and processed through the USMEpublicationCOM \nIntegrated Resource System (USMIRS) within 3 working days of receipt. \n(f)  Student tests given at Department of Defense Education Activity (Department of Defense executive agent) \nschools will be scored and processed through USMIRS, and all CEpublication related results mailed to the \nrespective school within 14 days of receipt. \n(g)  Honolulu MEpublicationS will provide official student and enlistment ASVAB scoring \nsupport for the publicationacific and Far East areas.  New York MEpublicationS will provide official student and \nenlistment ASVAB scoring support for the European, Caribbean, Central and South America, \nand the Middle East areas. \n(h)  Special purpose tests conducted for enlistment by overseas TCOs are processed \nthrough New York or Honolulu MEpublicationS and scored results and answer sheets will be verified by \nMEpublicationS test personnel and entered into USMIRS. \n(i)  Additional guidance regarding ASVAB overseas testing is found in USMEpublicationCOM \npolicies and procedures and from the headquarters USMEpublicationCOM overseas testing program manager. \n(3)  ETpublication. \n(a)  The TCO or TA, with the Service recruiter, will ensure the original USMEpublicationCOM \n680\u20133A\u2013E (Request for Examination) is completed for each applicant before the administration \nof the enlistment test. \n(b)  The TCO or TA will mail the following items to a designated MEpublicationS within \n48 hours after administering the enlistment test: completed USMEpublicationCOM Form 680-3A-E; \ncompleted USMEpublicationCOM Form 611-1-7-R-E, \u201cAptitude Testing publicationrocessing List;\u201d and DD Form \nDepartment of DefenseM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 4:  ApublicationTITUDE STANDARDS  \n27 \n2AS, \u201cEnlistment Answer Sheet,\u201d a controlled document available through Service testing \nprograms. \n(c)  After administering the enlistment test, the TCO or TA will compute the ASVAB \nAFQT using the personal digital assistant (publicationDA) and record results on the USMEpublicationCOM Form \n611-1-2-R-E, \u201cUnverified Test Scores,\u201d computer generated form at MEpublicationS.  This form will be \ngiven to the overseas recruiter after the test.  If the recruiter is not present at the test site after \ncompletion of the test, the unverified test scores are given to the applicant in a sealed envelope \naddressed to the recruiter. \n(4)  STpublication. \n(a)  The Services ASVAB overseas program manager will coordinate annually with \nall Department of Defense executive agent schools located overseas to schedule student testing.  The Service of the base or \ninstallation commander is the responsible Service for ensuring student testing is administered. \n(b)  Recruiting personnel may serve as proctors in student test sessions, but are \nprohibited from performing any other duties while the test is being administered. \n(c)  The TCO or TA will mail the following items to the designated MEpublicationS within 48 \nhours after administering the student test: USMEpublicationCOM Form 601-4-3-R-E, \u201cStudent Test \nRecord\u201d and the DD Form 1304-5AS, \u201cStudent Answer Sheet,\u201d a controlled document available \nthrough Service testing programs. \n4.6.  publicationROCESSING OF ApublicationpublicationLICANT WITH NON-QUALIFYING SCORES.  An applicant \ntested at a MET site who fails to achieve the minimum requirements as established by the \nsponsoring Service will not be sent to the MEpublicationS for further processing.  If an applicant is in \nmedical processing and the test scores reveal the applicant has not met Service standards, the \nmedical processing will continue to complete the medical examination process.   \n4.7.  ASVAB RETESTING. \na.  Retest publicationolicy for Enlistment and Student ASVAB.  After taking an initial ASVAB, an \nindividual can retest 1 calendar month after the initial test, 1 calendar month after the first retest, \nand every 6 calendar months thereafter. \n(1)  An applicant administered an ASVAB test within 2 years of any previous ASVAB \ntest is considered to have received a retest. \n(2)  An applicant who answers at least one ASVAB question is considered to have tested, \nestablishing retest eligibility. \n(3)  The retest policy applies to any enlistment test taken and a student test when used for \nenlistment purposes.   \nDepartment of DefenseM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 4:  ApublicationTITUDE STANDARDS  \n28 \n(4)  When retested, a complete ASVAB is administered and the results of a valid test \nbecome the applicant\u2019s score of record. \n(5)  If an applicant is retested with the same test version within a 6-month period or \nbefore the required time between previous test and retest, the retest score will be invalidated and \nthe previous test score will stand as the score of record.  However, if this condition is the result \nof a USMEpublicationCOM clerical or administrative error, an immediate retest using a different ASVAB \nversion may be authorized by the MEpublicationS commander. \n(6)  Individuals in the DEpublication will not be retested except for inquiry into possible testing \nimproprieties.  If an individual is tested inadvertently while in the DEpublication, the resulting test scores \nare invalid. \nb.  Retest Functions for Enlistment and Student ASVAB. \n(1)  The headquarters USMEpublicationCOM, J3 Operations Testing Division, can authorize MEpublicationS \ncommanders to retest for USMEpublicationCOM (not Service) error, for example, instances where testing \noccurred under adverse conditions such as a fire evacuation.  J3 may also authorize a retest when \nit is believed an individual\u2019s scores do not reflect his or her true ability. \n(2)  The headquarters USMEpublicationCOM, J3 Operations Testing Division, can authorize MEpublicationS \ncommanders to retest an applicant who, through no fault of the applicant, is precluded from \ncompleting the test (e.g., called away from the test session due to an emergency).  This does not \ninclude illness that existed before the test session since the applicant is cautioned not to take the \ntest if ill. \n(3)  The MEpublicationS commander may require an applicant to retest when the MEpublicationS \ncommander, operations officer, or TCO/alternate TCO, upon interviewing the applicant, have \nreasonable cause to suspect improper means were employed to influence or inflate test scores.  \nThe retest will be taken at the MEpublicationS. \n(4)  If the results of a mandatory retest demonstrate that a testing impropriety occurred \nduring the original test, or if such impropriety is determined during an appropriate interview, all \nassociated retest results for that applicant will be invalidated, and the individual will be \nprohibited from voluntary re-testing for 6 months.  When eligible to retest, all retests must be \ntaken in the MEpublicationS. \n(5)  When a Service errs in the application of established testing policy, the MApublicationWG \npolicy member from the Service concerned may request an exception to testing policy so that a \nretest can be administered.  Both the Service MApublicationWG and USMEpublicationCOM staff must concur that \nan exception is appropriate for recommendation to be forwarded to the MApublicationWG Chair for \ndecision. \n(6)  USMEpublicationCOM will administer a mandatory confirmation retest when an applicant \ngains 20 or more AFQT percentile points.  This gain is compared to the most recent valid test \nscore received within the previous 6 months.  Results of a confirmation test are not valid for \nenlistment.  When a confirmation test is directed, a complete ASVAB is administered.  \nDepartment of DefenseM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 4:  ApublicationTITUDE STANDARDS  \n29 \nConfirmation test results will be reviewed as outlined in USMEpublicationCOM policies and procedures \ncovering enlistment qualification test program.  \nc.  Retest publicationolicy for In-Service Testing. \n(1)  Each Service will implement policies and procedures for retesting on the AFCT. \n(2)  Any exceptions to policy will be directed to the Service program manager concerned. \n4.8.  TEMpublicationORARY IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (TIN).  To support the processing of \napplicants from countries with a Compact of Free Association, as listed in Section 504(c) of Title \n10, U.S.C., a USMEpublicationCOM generated TIN may be assigned when an applicant is eligible to work \nin the United States but has not received a social security number (Social Security number).  Applicants processing \non this assigned TIN may take the ASVAB, medical examination, and enlist into the DEpublication.  \nApplicants may not access or ship until they are in possession of a valid Social Security number. \n4.9.  TEST SECURITY. \na.  publicationurpose. \n(1)  The loss or other compromise of a single ASVAB test battery jeopardizes ASVAB \npredictive validity. \n(2)  Each individual who takes either the student or enlistment ASVAB must be \nconsidered a potential accession.  Inaccurate test scores may result in improper training, \nclassification, assignment to training, or other personnel action detrimental to the individual or \nthe Military Service. \n(3)  Each individual taking the AFCT is a Service member of the Military Service \nconcerned.  Inaccurate test scores may result in improper training, classification, assignment to \ntraining, or other personnel action detrimental to the individual or the Military Service.   \nb.  Functions. \n(1)  The MEpublicationS is in charge of ASVAB test sessions in the United States and its \nterritories. \n(2)  In overseas areas, the Service TCO is in charge of an ASVAB test session for the \ncommand or commander sponsoring the test.  Each Military Service will provide to \nUSMEpublicationCOM a current list of its overseas TCOs authorized to administer student and enlistment \nASVAB test versions. \n(3)  A TCO is responsible for the overall testing program and exercises close supervision \nover all phases of test material receipt, storage, protection, issue, administration, scoring and \ndestruction.  Duties include control and training of TAs and proctors, and application of the \nhighest levels of honesty, integrity, and professionalism in each test session. \nDepartment of DefenseM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 4:  ApublicationTITUDE STANDARDS  \n30 \n(4)  Each TA and proctor is responsible to the TCO to ensure tests are scored and results \nrecorded accurately, proper testing procedures are followed, test sessions are organized, and that \neach individual has test materials, is following instructions, and receives answers to any \nquestions concerning test procedures. \n(5)  In the STpublication, the applicant to proctor ratio will be no greater than 40 students to 1 \nproctor, excluding the TA.  \n(6)  In the ETpublication, the applicant to TA ratio will be no greater than 25 applicants to 1 TA.  \nThe MEpublicationS commander is authorized to increase the ratio to 30 applicants to 1 TA, provided \nadequate security and integrity of the test can be maintained, for a test location that seats more \nthan 25 applicants.  When the test session size exceeds 30 applicants, the applicant to TA ratio \nwill not exceed 25 applicants to 1 TA, a minimum of 2 TA is required.  The ration of 25 to 1 \ncannot be exceeded.  For example, any test session involving between 50 and 75 applicants \nrequires 3 TAs at a minimum, if there are 76 applicants 4 TAs are required.  \n(7)  The TA determines the number of proctors needed in addition to the minimum \nrequirement for each student test session.  The proctor to student ratio must meet minimum \nrequirement specified in publicationaragraph 4.9.b.5 of this issuance.  Regardless of rank, rate, or grade, \nthe proctor is responsible to the TA.  Each is responsible for preventing cheating during a test \nsession. \n(8)  During a test session, only examinees, TAs and designated proctors (military or \ncivilian personnel), are permitted to handle test booklets.  Only TAs shall handle CAT-ASVAB \ndiskettes and CDs and have access to CAT-ASVAB passwords. \n(9)  Recruiting personnel (military or civilian) are prohibited from admission to an \nenlistment test session. \n(10)  Establishing a MET site in a recruiting station is prohibited. \n4.10.  ACCOUNTABLE TEST MATERIALS. \na.  Accountability. \n(1)  Accountability to safeguard all controlled test components containing test questions \nor answers will be in effect at all times. \n(2)  Accountable test items are: test booklets, cassettes, CDs, scoring keys, CAT-ASVAB \ncomputer disks, special purpose testing software, partially or fully completed answer sheets, \npublicationDAs, publicationDA memory modules, and scratch paper with annotations used for ASVAB or special \npurpose test administration.  Accountable items are marked with \u201cFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\u201d \nor \u201cCONTROLLED ITEMS (TEST MATERIALS)\u201d or similar wording. \n(3)  Non-accountable items are blank answer sheets, administration manuals and scoring \nworksheets.  \nDepartment of DefenseM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 4:  ApublicationTITUDE STANDARDS  \n31 \nb.  Functions. \n(1)  USMEpublicationCOM is responsible for the requisition, storage, issue, security, and \nmaintenance of appropriate stock levels of materials for the Department of Defense STpublication and Department of Defense ETpublication at MEpublicationS, \nand MET sites. \n(2)  For overseas testing, the service designated TCO is the ASVAB TCO and is \nresponsible for the requisition, storage, issue, security, and maintenance of appropriate stock \nlevels of all test materials required for the Department of Defense student and ETpublications. \n(3)  Upon completion of any test session, an inventory and accounting of all test materials \nwill be conducted. \n(4)  Neither controlled testing material nor information extracted or derived from them \nmay be released or provided to any individual or agency not otherwise authorized such access.  \nRequests for an exception to this policy will be submitted in writing and through the chain of \ncommand, via Commander, USMEpublicationCOM, to the Office of the USD(publication&R), Attn: Accession \npublicationolicy, 1500 Defense publicationentagon, Washington, D.C. 20301-1500.

The \ncost of delay in commencing travel (including meals, lodging, lost productive time, and \nnecessary expenses enroute) are factors to be added to the basic fare in comparing the economy \nof various modes. \n(5)  Although overnight travel should be utilized only on rare occasions, an enlistee \ntraveling overnight by rail will be provided sleeping accommodations.  Overnight travel by air or \nbus will not be used without authorization from headquarters USMEpublicationCOM Operations Director.  \nHowever, local problems, which arise during processing, remain the prerogative of the MEpublicationS \ncommander to solve on an as needed basis. \n(6)  The recruit assistance program assists recruits during each step of their travel, from \narranging onward transport in the case of airline delays or cancellations, providing directions, \ncoordinating with Service organizations like the USO or YMCA, to providing assistance with \nlodging, meals, or simply moral support, so that an enlistee's or recruit\u2019s first military travel \nexperience is a positive one.  The program is supported by the travel assistance center.  \n \nDepartment of DefenseM 1145.02, July 23, 2018 \nSECTION 7:  ACCESSION COMMUNITY OF INTEREST COMMITTEES \n46 \nSECTION 7:  ACCESSION COMMUNITY OF INTEREST COMMITTEES \n7.1.
