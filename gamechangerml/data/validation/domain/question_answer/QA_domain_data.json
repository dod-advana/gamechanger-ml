                "Virginia's Democratic-controlled Legislature passed a bill legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana on Wednesday, making it the 16th state to take the step. Under Virginia's new law, adults ages 21 and over can possess an ounce or less of marijuana beginning on July 1, rather than Jan. 1, 2024. Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, proposed moving up the date, arguing it would be a mistake to continue to penalize people for possessing a drug that would soon be legal. Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, also a Democrat, broke a 20-20 vote tie in Virginia's Senate to pass the bill. No Republicans supported the measure. Democratic House of Delegates Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn hailed the plan. Today, with the Governor's amendments, we will have made tremendous progress in ending the targeting of Black and brown Virginians through selective enforcement of marijuana prohibition by this summer she said in a statement. Republicans voiced a number of objections to what they characterized as an unwieldy, nearly 300-page bill. Several criticized measures that would grant licensing preferences to people and groups who've been affected by the war on drugs and make it easier for workers in the industry to unionize. Senate Minority Leader Tommy Norment also questioned Northam's motives.",
                "We have a governor who wants to contribute to the resurrection of his legacy, Norment said, referring to the 2019 discovery of a racist photo in Northam's 1984 medical school yearbook. The accelerated timeline sets Virginia cannabis consumers in an unusual predicament. While it will be legal to grow up to four marijuana plants beginning July 1, it could be several years before the state begins licensing recreational marijuana retailers. And unlike other states, the law won't allow the commonwealth's existing medical dispensaries to begin selling to all adults immediately. Jenn Michelle Pedini, executive director of Virginia NORML, called legalization an incredible victory but said the group would continue to push to allow retail sales to begin sooner.",
                "In the interest of public and consumer safety, Virginians 21 and older should be able to purchase retail cannabis products at the already operational dispensaries in 2021, not in 2024, Pedini said in a statement. Such a delay will only exacerbate the divide for equity applicants and embolden illicit activity. Northam and other Democrats pitched marijuana legalization as a way to address the historic harms of the war on drugs. One state study found Black Virginians were 3.5 times more likely to be arrested on marijuana charges compared with white people. Those trends persisted even after Virginia reduced penalties for possession to a $25 civil fine. New York and New Jersey also focused on addressing those patterns when governors in those states signed laws to legalize recreational marijuana this year. Northam's proposal sets aside 30% of funds to go to communities affected by the war on drugs, compared with 70% in New Jersey. Another 40% of Virginia's revenue will go toward early childhood education, with the remainder funding public health programs and substance abuse treatment.",
                "Those plans, and much of the bill's regulatory framework, are still tentative; Virginia lawmakers will have to approve them again during their general session next year. Some criminal justice advocates say lawmakers should also revisit language that creates a penalty for driving with an open container of marijuana. In the absence of retail sales, some members of law enforcement said it's not clear what a container of marijuana will be. The bill specifies a category of social equity applicants, such as people who've been charged with marijuana-related offenses or who graduated from historically Black colleges and universities. Those entrepreneurs will be given preference when the state grants licensing. Mike Thomas, a Black hemp cultivator based in Richmond who served jail time for marijuana possession, said those entrepreneurs deserved special attention. Thomas said he looked forward to offering his own line of organic, craft cannabis. Being that the arrest rate wasn't the same for everyone, I don't think the business opportunities should be the same for everyone"

The 2018 National Defense Strategy articulates advancements in artificial intelligence ( AI ) that will present strategic opportunities and risks .The Department of Defense ( Do D ) has directed the establishment of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center ( JAIC ) under the Do D Chief Information Officer .The JAIC serves as the accelerator and synchronizer of Do D AI activities .The Do D Chief Information Officer is seeking partnership with the Military Services as sponsors in three locations : the Pentagon , the National Capital Region , and Pittsburgh , PA .Large scale efforts or clusters of closely related joint urgent challenges will be identified as National Military Initiatives and will be executed in partnership across Do D . These efforts serve as opportunities for synergy among efforts the respective stakeholders may initiate to achieve their statutory responsibilities . 3 . The Army is establishing the Army AI Task Force ( A AI TF ) that will narrow an existing AI capability gap by leveraging current technological applications to enhance our warfighters , preserve peace , and , if required , fight to win . 4 . The purpose of this directive is to establish a scalable A AI TF under U.S . Army Futures Command ( AFC ) consisting of hand selected Army personnel with specific skillsets to lead Army AI efforts and support Do D projects , principally based at Carnegie Mellon University .The end state is an empowered team that rapidly integrates and synchronizes AI activities across the Army enterprise and Do D ’s National Military Initiatives . 5 . A AI TF leaders and talent have been selected to start work immediately in coordination with JAIC ’s efforts .The A AI TF will establish its footprint in accordance with Carnegie Mellon ’s 90 day occupation plan , formally organize under AFC , develop and then implement an Army AI Strategy , and initiate pilot projects in coordination with S E C R E T AR Y O F T H E A R M Y W A S H I N G T O N "

                "The United States Army (USA) is the land service branch of the United States Armed Forces. It is one of the eight U.S. uniformed services, and is designated as the Army of the United States in the U.S. Constitution. As the oldest and most senior branch of the U.S. military in order of precedence, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783)—before the United States of America was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784 to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself to be a continuation of the Continental Army, and thus  considers its institutional inception to be the origin of that armed force in 1775.The U.S. Army is a uniformed service of the United States and is part of the Department of the Army, which is one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense. The U.S. Army is headed by a civilian senior appointed civil servant, the secretary of the Army (SECARMY) and by a chief military officer, the chief of staff of the Army (CSA) who is also a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It is the largest military branch, and in the fiscal year 2020, the projected end strength for the Regular Army (USA) was 480,893 soldiers; the Army National Guard (ARNG) had 336,129 soldiers and the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) had 188,703 soldiers; the combined-component strength of the U.S. Army was 1,005,725 soldiers. As a branch of the armed forces, the mission of the U.S. Army is 'to fight and win our Nation's wars, by providing prompt, sustained land dominance, across the full range of military operations and the spectrum of conflict, in support of combatant commanders'. The branch participates in conflicts worldwide and is the major ground-based offensive and defensive force of the United States.",

                "GO 15 GENERAL ORDERS HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY No .15 Washington , DC , 14 June 1975 THE UNITED STATES ARMY BICENTENNIAL Today , the United States Army marks the 200th anniversary of its founding by the Continental Congress on 14 June 1775 .In two centuries of service , the Army has never failed our Nation .Our military heritage is a proud record of service in both war and peace , perpetuating the principles of the Declaration of Independence , and sustaining the sanctity of the Constitution . : History speaks of a legacy bequeathed to us by those first American soldiers in 1775—a legacy of determination and grit .Those early patriots fresh from fields and shops , often with little more than a semblance of training , faced a powerful foe on the battlefield while struggling against hunger , cold , despair , and disease .Short of everything except courage and will , they persevered to win .Since that time , American soldiers traditionally have been defenders of freedom and guardians of peace .The surviving spirit of those who have gone before demands that we also look ahead to the continued necessity for a creditable force comprised of dedicated soldiers .It is both our debt and duty to provide the Nation the kind of Army it must have .We will always be prepared to fight when our civilian leaders and the American people call upon us to do so .Further , we must continue to carry out the noncombat missions for which the Army is so uniquely qualified and through which the Army has contributed inestimably to the development of the Nation and its resources , to relief of suffering , and to the overall betterment of life for all Americans .Thus , on this hailowed day , we look back with pride and forward with dedication and determination .We , who are the United States Army , rededicate ourselves to the responsibility and privilege of serving as the Nation ’s VANGUARD OF FREEDOM .TAGO 463A—June 580-476°—73 1 ",
                "The same column also carried a riposte from retired Army Col Odus C . Kerley to Capt Fox 's assertion that the Marine Corps is older than the other branches of the U.S . armed services : Please know that the Army of our country is the oldest and senior service .The Continental Congress created the Continental Army June 14 , 1775 .Before this American colonial troops fought in the French and Indian War .It was not until Nov . 10 , 1775 , when the Continental Congress established the Marine Corps , which was created to fight in the Revolutionary War after which no Marine Corps , as such , existed .Congress re created the Corps as a military service in 1798 .In 1789 Congress established the War Department to direct military affairs .This was nearly 10 years before the re creation of the Marine Corps .In 1834 , Congress placed the Marine Corps directly under the Secretary of the Navy .There is a great difference in a corps and an army .Our Army has in its organization many corps . \"Col Kerley has it right but he might also have said that the \" American colonial troops \" he cited included Marines .I have been fighting a running battle with Army historians on this score for years , most particularly with Col John R . Elting , USA ( Ret . ) .Our argument centers on whether members of the American Regiment , which was in existence from 1739 to 1742 and landed at Cartagena with Adm Vernon , were Marines or soldiers .We call them \" Gooch 's Marines . \"The Army calls them the \" 61st Foot . \"Most recently Col Elting had written me concerning the term \" soldier of the sea \" : While toiling on our dictionary of service talk , I looked at Leonard (?) Nason 's Sergeant Eadie , another of those vanished great books of World War I .In it , American soldiers — apparently of the 2d Infantry Division — are singing a disrespectful ditty with the line : \" So yell t 'hell with Kaiser Bill and the soldiers of the sea . \"They had just had an encounter with some Marine MPs .So my question is — did the Marines ever call themselves \" soldiers of the sea , \" or were the dogfaces taking poetic license ?I know the 4 British used \" sea soldiers \" on occasion .In answering John Eking I called his attention to Col Robert D . Heinl 's use of Soldiers of the Sea as the title of his 1962 history of the Marine Corps .Bob does not explain his selection or its origin ; however , Liddell Hart in the Forewoid says , \" The title , Soldiers of the Sea , is apt — epitomizing the adaptability , and thus the flexibility that such an amphibious fighting service possesses . \"Bob Hem ! must certainly have known that the same title was used by Willis J . Abbot in his 1918 history of the Corps .Abbot also fails to say why he chose \" Soldiers of the Sea , \" but in the early pages of his book he repeats the Pepys ' diary story of \" Tell it to the Marines . \"Both Thomason and Abbot have Pepys using the term \" sea soldier , \" which has been around for at least three centuries .On 28 October 1664 , the date the Royal Marines count as their birthday , Charles II ordered \" that 1200 land Souldjers be forwith raysed , . for Sea Service . \"A verse by an unknown poet in W\"itand Drollery , 1682 , contains the line , \" A health to brave Sea Soldiers all The Oxford English Dictionary , that ultimate authority on etymology , has a 1690 entry , \" The earls of Pembroke and Torrington have each a commission to raise a marine regiment , \" and one for 1699 , \" The Marine Soldiers on board receive the Wages of a Sailor . \"A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue , Francis Grose , Editor , 1785 , has a scurrilous entry , \" Marine Officer , an empty bottle , marine officers being held useless by the seamen . \"But Capt George Smith in his Universal Military Dictionary , 1779 , has it about right : \" Marines , a body of soldiers , raised for the seaservice , and trained to fight either in a naval engagement , or in an action on shore . \"While I was laboring in my own vineyard , Billy Bob Crim had written to Maj Anthony G . Brown , MBE , RM ( Ret ) , Director , Royal Marines Museum , Eastney , who came up with a clutch of clippings including a 1944 letter to The Times in which Lt Col W . P . Drury , RM , confesses that the \" alleged interview between Charles II and Mr . Pepys . was an only too successful leg pull perpetrated by me in my unregenerate youth . \"A 1951 issue of Globe and Laurel reprinted a more complete explanation by Lt Col Drury published elsewhere .He had first used the Pepys story in a volume of short stories he had published in 1904 — plenty of time for Abbot and Thomason to pick it up ."
