POLICY It is Do D policy that : 4.1 . When in house sources are insufficient to support the medical mission of the Military Departments or in using sound business judgment it is more efficient to do so , PSCs may be executed for physicians and other HCPs .4.2 .

PSCs shall be subject to the same quality assurance , risk management , credentials review , and clinical privileging standards , including licensure , as those required of military and civil service HCPs .4.4 .All PSCs must be cost effective when compared to any other method ( e.g . , military and civil service , etc . ) available to the MTF commander in providing the required healthcare .If the MTF commander is unable to obtain the required services through other more cost effective means , the cost to the Government to provide the services through a PSC must be less than , or equal to , the projected Government cost under CHAMPUS for the same services .4.5 . PSC is the preferred type of contract when : the descriptive elements of the services to be provided , as stated in FAR Subpart 37.104 ( reference ( b ) ) , have essentially the same attributes as are present for services performed by military or civil service HCPs of the same type ( e.g . , physicians and nurses , etc . ) at the same facility ; and the services of the military , civil service , and PSC HCPs of the same type are to be integrated in predominant respects .DODI 6025.5 , January 6 , 95 2. 4.6 .The rights , benefits , and compensation of PSC contractors providing services under PSCs shall be determined solely in accordance with the PSC .4.7 .In no case shall the total amount of compensation paid to an individual in any year under a PSC exceed the full time equivalent rate of 200,000 dollars each year , except that this cap may be adjusted to equal any change in the amount of annual compensation ( excluding the allowances for expenses ) specified in Section 102 of 3 U.S.C . ( reference ( e ) ) .4.8 .The existence of an employer employee relationship created by a PSC shall result generally in the treatment of a PSC HCP similar to a Do D employee for many purposes .Included in this similar treatment is that Federal Tort Claims Act ( reference ( f ) ) claims alleging negligence by a PSC HCP shall be processed by the Department of Defense as claims alleging negligence by Do D military or civil service employees .As a result , the PSC HCP is not required to maintain medical malpractice liability insurance .5 . RESPONSIBILITIES 5.1 .The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs shall : 5.1.1 . Be responsible for monitoring the PSC program .5.1.2 . Review the procedures established by the Military Departments to ensure the cost effectiveness and/or neutrality of PSCs .5.1.3 .

Prorated compensation based on hourly , daily , or weekly rates may be awarded when a contractor 's services are not required on a full time basis .6.3 . Each PSC must contain language specifically stating : 6.3.1 .That the contract is a personal services contract and that the contract is intended to create an employer employee relationship between the Government and the individual HCPs .6.3.2 .That the performance of the individual HCP ( s ) under the PSC is subject to day to day supervision and control by healthcare facility personnel comparable to that exercised over military and civil service HCPs engaged in comparable work ; and 6.3.3 .That any personal injury claims alleging negligence by the individual HCPs within the scope of the HCP 's performance of the PSC shall be processed by Do D as claims alleging negligence by Do D military or civil service HCPs ; and 6.3.4 .The PSC does not create an employer employee relationship between the Government and any corporation , partnership , business association or other party or legal entity with which the individual HCP ( s ) may be associated .7 .
